I hope everyone had an enjoyable 4<sup>th</sup> of July! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>We didn‚Äôt do much to celebrate today.<br>Normally, we would get together with my family, hang out, eat some yummy food, and (at least before Elayne was born) watch some fireworks. </p>
<p>This year was a little different. My mom has Covid right now. So we didn‚Äôt get together with them. Instead, we went out to breakfast as a family. Our initial plan had been to get breakfast and then go checkout a new park and playground for Elayne. But then it started raining. So the park portion of our plan was canceled. </p>
<p>Other than breakfast, we played with Elayne and tried to finish getting our house all settled.<br>Yes, we are still working on the house. We‚Äôve only been in this new house a couple months, and we have so much we want to do. And it‚Äôs a bigger house, so we‚Äôre buying more furniture, more rugs, artwork, etc. So it has been a slow process. But I am determined to get it looking mostly done because we are having friends over this coming weekend. </p>

</div>

<p>Anyways, even though we didn‚Äôt have major plans for today, and we weren‚Äôt getting together with anyone, I decided I still wanted to do some festive baking. So Elayne and I made a <a href="/2023/07/04/BerryIceboxCake/" title="Berry Icebox Cake">Berry Icebox Cake</a>.</p>

Happy 4<sup>th</sup> of July! These blueberry treats are a delicious and festive snack for the holiday. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>This year, in addition to the <a href="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyCake/" title="4th of July Cake">4th of July Cake</a>, I also made these blueberry treats. I saw the idea online and thought ‚ÄúHey, those look easy and cute‚Äù. I will say, they were very easy, but also very tedious, which I guess I should have expected. But they did turn out pretty cute, and they tasted good. Everyone enjoyed them, so that‚Äôs a win. </p>
<p>These treats were not nearly as exciting as the flag cake I also made for our family celebration this year. But they are still a good option, especially for someone who doesn‚Äôt want to expend the time and energy for something as in depth as the cake. </p>
<p>So what do you need to make these? </p>
<ul>
    <li>Blueberries</li>
    <li>White chocolate bark</li>
    <li>Red sugar sprinkles</li>
    <li>Toothpicks</li>
</ul>

<div style="display:flex;">
By "white chocolate bark", I mean something like this one to the right. It could be called bark or chocolate coating. This kind of chocolate will harden well after it cools. It is the kind of chocolate I use for anything that I dip in chocolate. Making chocolate dipped pretzels, chocolate covered Oreos, etc? Chocolate bark is the way to go. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyBlueberries/WhiteChocolateBark.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
And, in case you don't know what sugar sprinkles are, they look like those pictured to the right. They are essentially just sugar crystals with coloring. You can find them in pretty much any color you want. Currently at my house, I have red, green, orange, black, gold, and silver. These sprinkles are great for all types of decorating. Cakes, cupcakes, sugar cookies, etc. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyBlueberries/RedSugarSprinkles.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
So, first thing: Put the blueberries on the toothpicks. You need 3 blueberries per toothpick. I tried to have the 3 blueberries all about the same size. Not very important, just makes them look neater. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyBlueberries/July4Blueberries1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, you need to melt the white chocolate. I find it best to do this using a double boiler. If you‚Äôre not familiar with double boilers, they are essentially two stacked pots. You put water in the bottom pot, and in the top pot, you put the chocolate. The water boils, creating steam, which then heats the chocolate. This allows the chocolate to melt without coming into direct contact with the heat from the stove. Using a double boiler helps to prevent the chocolate from burning. </p>
<p>Dip the bottom two blueberries into the white chocolate. Then, dip the bottom blueberry into the red sprinkles. You need to do this before the chocolate cools. Place the blueberry stick on a sheet of wax paper to completely cool and harden. I like to use wax paper anytime I am dipping something in chocolate. The wax paper keeps your treats from sticking. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Once the chocolate hardens, you can enjoy your blueberry treat! They didn't turn out quite as neat as I had hoped. In future, I may wait just a minute after dipping the blueberries in the chocolate before dipping them into the sprinkles. When I made mine, I went from white chocolate to sprinkles immediately, so they chocolate was still very very hot. Because of this, the chocolate started to drip while I was dipping it into the sprinkles.

Hi, welcome to the next phase of my life. 

<br>  
<span id="more"></span>

<p>My name is Taylor Mark. I have a wonderful husband, Tommy, and a beautiful daughter, Elayne. </p>
<p>Up until this year, I have worked in the software industry, been self-sufficient, and have had the freedom to do most of what I wanted.<br>But now, I recently quit my job to stay home and raise my daughter. She is 5 months old right now, and I couldn‚Äôt be more in love. Her smile is contagious, and she loves to laugh. </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<div style="display:flex;"> 
During pregnancy, I couldn't imagine how different my life would be once Elayne was born. Obviously, I knew things would change - I just couldn't comprehend how much. So now here I am, a full-time stay-at-home mom. It is a little weird not going into an office everyday, or seeing any coworkers. But I'm not complaining. I get to spend everyday with my precious baby girl. I get to see how she changes and grows everyday. And believe me, she changes so fast. I am very lucky to be able to raise her instead of needing to work. 
<div>
  <img src="/2022/03/12/AboutMe/StPatricksDay.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>
 
<p>But as happy as I am to stay home with her, I did need something else to focus on, so that I didn‚Äôt spend <strong><em>all</em></strong> of my little free time doing housework and watching tv. Even moms need their own hobbies. </p>
<p>I have been baking since I was very young. Growing up, my mom always baked for the holidays, and as we got older, my sisters and I would help out. We all wanted to make baked goods for our friends for the holidays. But when you‚Äôre handing them out at school, you also don‚Äôt want to exclude people, and it resulted in us making hundreds of treats each year. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Since then, I have continued baking for various events, or just for no reason at all. I like to host parties, game nights, football game viewings, etc. Prior to Covid, I hosted a Halloween party several years in a row. I hosted my sister's wedding shower, and a few birthday parties. Each time, I made all the food myself, simply because that's what I enjoy doing. For as long back as I can remember, I have found baking to be exciting and a great way to get my mind off my stress. I like to try new recipes, and then have my friends, neighbors, or coworkers give their opinions of them; they have been great guinea pigs over the years üòä 
<div>

<p>In this blog, I hope to share much of my baking knowledge, in addition to recipes I like. I will also include recipes for appetizers&#x2F;finger foods, as these are my go-to party foods. I hope I can inspire some amateur bakers and party hosts. </p>

Happy 4<sup>th</sup>! We actually celebrated with my family yesterday. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>No fireworks for us this year, because Elayne is only 9 months old, and her bedtime is at 7:00. So we definitely were not about to try to keep her up until 10:00pm. But, we got together with family earlier in the day, went to a brewery, and then had an early dinner at my parents‚Äô house. It was actually really nice not fighting crowds and traffic to go see fireworks. I‚Äôve always loved watching fireworks, but sometimes it just feels like it‚Äôs a lot of work to get there hours early and camp out your spot, all for a show that lasts 20 minutes. So I really enjoyed our relaxing day instead. And I think Elayne had a good first 4<sup>th</sup> of July. </p>
<img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyCake/ElayneJuly4.jpg" class="side-by-side">

<p>So since the family was getting together, I offered to bring dessert, because I had been wanting to try this cake.<br>Just an ordinary white cake, but it looks like an American flag when you cut into the middle! I have seen pictures where other people have made them, but I‚Äôve never tried it myself. Overall, it turned out better than I expected, although my cake layers are not very uniform. That is something I want to work on. I‚Äôm planning to buy some of the cake strips that make your cakes bake evenly, but I haven‚Äôt tried them yet. But you can still tell that my cake is an American flag, so I call that a success! </p>
<p>So how does one go about making a cake like this? </p>
<p>First, you need to make your cakes. Since this was more an exercise in cake decorating, as opposed to baking, and because I have limited free time these days, I used box cake mixes. I bought 2 boxes of white cake mix, so that I could make 4 round cakes. Of these 4 cakes, the breakdown was this: 2 red cakes, 1 white cake, and 1 blue cake. </p>
<p>Make your cake batters as directed on the box. Or, if you‚Äôre feeling up for a challenge, make them from scratch! One thing to note if you‚Äôre using box cake mix: There <i>is</i> a difference in the whole egg versus egg white recipes in the directions. If you use the egg white recipe, you will end up with an actually white cake. On the other hand, the whole egg recipe results in a cake that is a little more yellow in color. I prefer using the egg white recipe, especially when I‚Äôm going to be using food coloring. </p>
<p>I found it easiest to make the batter from one box at a time. Then divide this batter in half so that you have the batter for 2 round cake pans. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
So, make the batter with the first box. Divide it in half. One half can remain without food coloring (this will be your white cake). In the other half, mix your blue food coloring. 
In the blue cake, I also decided to try something new. I got some white chocolate chips, coated them in a little flour, and mixed them into my blue cake mix. The purpose of coating them in flour is so that the chips don't all sink to the bottom of the cake. My hope was that the white chocolate chips would look like the stars on the flag. I will say, this didn't work quite as well as I had hoped. The chocolate chips were delicious in the cake, so that's a win. But many of them did still fall toward the bottom of the cake (maybe I needed more flour?), and you really couldn't see them much when you cut the cake. It was still worth a try, and if I make this cake again, I will probably add them again, if for no other reason than people really seemed to enjoy the surprise of tasting them in there. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyCake/July4Cake4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<br>
<div style="display:flex;">
Next, make the batter with the second box. There is no need to divide this batter, as we need 2 red cakes. So mix your red food coloring into the entire batch of batter. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyCake/July4Cake1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Your cake pans need to be greased and floured before pouring the batter into them. By doing this, you‚Äôre decreasing the chances your cakes from sticking. If you don‚Äôt know how to do this, see my post <a href="/2022/07/04/GreaseFlourPans/" title="How to Grease &amp; Flour Cake Pans">How to Grease &amp; Flour Cake Pans</a>.</p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Bake your cakes as directed on the box or in your recipe. Then let the cakes cool before removing from the pans. If your cakes are still warm when you try to cut them, they will fall apart much more easily. Also, if the cakes are still warm when you begin frosting them, the icing will become melty and messy. Neither of which is what we want. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyCake/July4Cake7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Once the cakes are cool, you can begin cutting them so that they are ready to assemble. I used a long serrated bread knife to cut the cakes in half to form thin layers. Special tools for this specific purpose do exist; I just don‚Äôt have one, and the knife worked just fine. I also used a large circle cookie cutter to get the correct cake shapes. </p>
<p>For the blue cake, do not cut this layer in half. We want to use the full layer. Use the cookie cutter to remove the center of the cake. The center can be discarded, or set aside for another purpose. We only need the outer ring of the blue cake. </p>
<p>For the white cake, use the bread knife to cut the layer in half, making 2 thin layers. Keep the entire bottom layer in tact. For the top layer, use the cookie cutter to cut out the center of the cake. Keep the center circle, and you can discard the outer ring. </p>
<p>For the red cakes, use the bread knife to cut the 1<sup>st</sup> cake in half, resulting in 2 thin layers. These layers can be kept as is; we will use the entire layer. For the 2<sup>nd</sup> cake, I found it easiest to first use the cookie cutter to cut out the middle. The outer ring can be discarded. Then, slice the middle circle in half using the bread knife, resulting in 2 thin, small circle layers. Only 1 of these layers will actually be used; the other may be discarded. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
After cutting all the cakes, you end up with the following pieces: 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyCake/July4Cake9.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
...and the following pieces that can be discarded: 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyCake/July4Cake8.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Now that your cakes are cut, you can begin assembling! You‚Äôll want to place each layer, then frost the top, before placing the next layer on top of that. The order should go like this: </p>
<ol>
    <li>Full <span style="color:red;">Red</span> layer</li>
    <li>Full White layer</li>
    <li>Full <span style="color:red;">Red</span> layer</li>
    <li><span style="color:blue;">Blue</span> outer ring</li>
    <li>White inner circle (inside the <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> ring)</li>
    <li><span style="color:red;">Red</span> inner circle (inside the <span style="color:blue;">blue</span> ring)</li>
</ol>
<div style="display:flex;">
Once it is fully assembled with all of the above layers, your cake should look like this: 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyCake/July4Cake10.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, we want to apply a crumb coat of icing. If you‚Äôre short on time, you could skip this step. It isn‚Äôt crucial, but‚Ä¶having a crumb coat will make your final layer of frosting look much neater. Your choice. If you don‚Äôt know how to do a crumb coat, visit my post <a href="/2022/07/04/CrumbCoat/" title="How to Apply a Crumb Coat of Icing">How to Apply a Crumb Coat of Icing</a>. </p>
<div style="text-align:right;"><img src="/2022/07/04/4thOfJulyCake/July4Cake11.jpg" class="floating-image"></div>
<br>
<div style="display:flex;">
After the crumb coat is applied and your cake has chilled, you can add the final layer of frosting and then decorate your cake! I chose to keep the frosting layer white and add blue and red borders and fireworks. This is mostly because I enjoy piping icing. For me, piping icing always turns out looking better than simply spreading it onto the cake. I think this is because I always criticize my own work, and I always see my icing as messy when I spread it on. So, adding piped icing both covers up some messy spots, and also distracts from looking at the spread icing. But any decoration you want is great! That's one of the best things about baking; it allows you to be creative and try out some new things.

    <title>Apple Cinnamon Cookies</title>

These Apple Cinnamon Cookies are the perfect introduction to fall. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>I know it‚Äôs not quite fall yet, but I‚Äôm already getting excited for it. I made these cookies because we went over to a friend‚Äôs house to watch the first Georgia Tech football game of the season. Although Tech lost, everyone loved the cookies. They have a very soft texture, almost like bread. And they are topped with a maple glaze that just brings the cookie to the next level. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/02/AppleCinnamonCookies/AppleCinnamonCookies1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
In a medium mixing bowl, mix together the flour, old-fashioned oats, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves, and salt. Set aside. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/02/AppleCinnamonCookies/AppleCinnamonCookies4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and brown sugar, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add in the egg and vanilla, and mix again until all ingredients are well-combined. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/02/AppleCinnamonCookies/AppleCinnamonCookies3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Gradually add the set-aside flour mixture into the butter/sugar mixture. Mix between each addition of flour. It's best to add the flour and other dry ingredients slowly because if you add it all in at once and attempt to mix, flour will fly everywhere. It makes a huge mess. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/02/AppleCinnamonCookies/AppleCinnamonCookies5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, peel and finely chop the apple. You want the pieces to be pretty small. If they are too big, or if there is too much apple, the cookie dough will not hold together very well. Sprinkle the lemon juice over the apple pieces, and toss to coat. Pour the apple pieces into the cookie dough, and stir to combine. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/02/AppleCinnamonCookies/AppleCinnamonCookies7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Scoop the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the cookies start to turn golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for a few minutes. Then remove from the pan and allow to cool completely. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/09/02/AppleCinnamonCookies/AppleCinnamonCookies8.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Next, make the glaze. In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, milk, and syrup. Whisk until the ingredients are combined and the mixture is smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cookies. Allow the glaze to set before serving or stacking the cookies. </p>

Baked Brie is an easy, delicious appetizer for your next gathering.

<p>My mom used to make this recipe when I was growing up. It was so easy to make, and we all loved it, so it quickly became a family favorite. </p>
<p>It can be a little messy once it is split open, and it‚Äôs not quite as classy as bite-sized foods. So I usually make this for very casual get-togethers, as opposed to nicer parties. So I made this for our game night the other week. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
It is very quick and simple to make, and you don't need many ingredients. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/25/BakedBrie/BakedBrie3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Start by making sure your puff pastry is thawed. You‚Äôll find the puff pastry in the frozen section of your grocery store. Make sure you get the one that says ‚Äúsheets‚Äù. There is another type that are cups. I made the mistake of accidently picking up the wrong one once. And then I had to ask a friend to stop by the store on her way over! </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Preheat your oven to 350¬∞F. Place the thawed puff pastry into a pie plate. I highly recommend using a pie plate or another dish with sides. If your pastry is not sealed well enough and cheese seeps out, it could be a mess if it runs off the pan. Spread a thin layer of apricot preserves on top. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/25/BakedBrie/BakedBrie1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, use a small knife to cut away asa much of the rind as possible from the brie. It doesn't need to be perfect. If there is some rind left over, it's not a big deal. The entire thing is edible. I just like to cut away the majority of the rind so that you only taste the brie. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/25/BakedBrie/BakedBrie5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Place the brie in the center of the pastry. Top it with more apricot preserves and some sliced almonds.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/25/BakedBrie/BakedBrie6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, fold up the corners of the pastry and seal it around the brie. It is important that it is sealed well so that the cheese does not seep out. Top the puff pastry with more apricot preserves and more sliced almonds. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/25/BakedBrie/BakedBrie2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Finally, bake the brie for 15-20 minutes, until the puff pastry is golden brown. Serve your brie with crackers. My favorite to use is Wheat Thins, but any crackers will work well. </p>

Muddy Buddies are always a delicious treat, and this recipe is a fun twist on the classic.

<p>Recently, I‚Äôve become a big fan of banana cream. Not sure where it came from, because I never really cared about it one way or the other until the past year or so. Now I love it. </p>
<p>I made these muddy buddies when we had Tommy‚Äôs coworkers over, and I received lots of compliments about them. They are addicting, and I could seriously just stand there munching until the whole bowl is finished. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
This is an easy treat to make, not requiring many ingredients or baking experience. Start by measuring out 6 cups of Chex cereal into a large bowl. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/18/BananaCreamPieMuddyBuddies/BananaCreamPieMuddyBuddies6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
In a small pan, combine the butter, white chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and milk. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the ingredients are melted and combined. Then add in the dry pudding mix, and stir until fully incorporated. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/18/BananaCreamPieMuddyBuddies/BananaCreamPieMuddyBuddies5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Pour the butter mixture over the Chex cereal. Stir until the Chex is fully coated. Transfer the Chex to a gallon ziploc bag. Add 1¬Ω c powdered sugar into the ziploc bag. </p>

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Seal the bag well, and shake it until the Chex are fully coated in powdered sugar. 
Spread the Chex out on waxed paper. Sprinkle the remaining ¬Ω c powdered sugar over the top. Allow to harden, then serve immediatley.

    <title>Banana Cupcakes w/ Chocolate Peanut Butter Frosting</title>
    <url>/2023/01/30/BananaCupcakes/</url>

Chocolate and Peanut Butter is such a classic flavor combination. And Peanut Butter and Banana is another delicious one. So why not have all three delicious flavors together? 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>I made this recipe during 2020. We were desperate to see people, tired of being cooped up in the house. So we had a couple friends over for a socially distant, outdoor hangout. We pulled the tv into the garage and set up some chairs (6 feet apart). And we watched a Georgia Tech football game. </p>
<p>This recipe is a little more time consuming, since in addition to making the cupcakes, you also have to make two difference frostings. But we weren‚Äôt going out anywhere, and we had no real plans during 2020, so I had a lot of free time on my hands. And I needed to find some fun things to occupy my time so that I didn‚Äôt go crazy or get depressed. Because let‚Äôs be real, I was already a little depressed not being able to see many people, or hug my family when we hung out with them outdoors. Not a fun time. </p>
<p>But back to the cupcakes.<br>We start by making the cupcakes. First, preheat the oven to 350¬∞F, and line your muffin pan with cupcake liners. </p>
<p>To make the cupcake batter, beat the softened butter, brown sugar, and sugar together until creamy. Add in the eggs and mix again. Then, add the mashed bananas and vanilla, and mix until all ingredients are combined. </p>
<p>In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing between each addition. Then add in the buttermilk and mix until all ingredients are combined. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips. </p>
<p>Evenly distribute the batter into the cupcakes liners, filling them about ‚Öî full. Bake for 17-19 minutes, until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool fully before adding the frosting. </p>
<p>Now, we need to make the frostings. Let‚Äôs start with the chocolate one. Beat the softened butter until it‚Äôs creamy. In a separate bowl, sift together the powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Slowly add the powdered sugar&#x2F;cocoa mixture, heavy cream, and vanilla to the butter. Mix between each addition. Beat the frosting on high speed until fully combined and creamy. Set the chocolate frosting aside while we make the peanut butter frosting.</p>
<p>For the peanut butter frosting, mix together the peanut butter and softened butter until it‚Äôs creamy. Then mix in the powdered sugar and vanilla. Finally, add the heavy cream, and mix on high until the frosting is creamy. </p>
<p>Once the cupcakes are fully cooled, we can swirl the frosting on top. In order to get the frosting to swirl together, I place both frostings into a single pastry bag. To make this process easier, place the pastry bag into a large cup so that the pastry bag will stay open while you spoon in the frosting. Then spoon the chocolate frosting into one side of the pastry bag, and spoon the other peanut butter frosting into the other side. Now, when you squeeze the frosting out, you will get a nice swirl of chocolate and peanut butter üòä </p>

These Banana Split Cookies are a fun, unique cookie to have at your next get-together.

<p>They have a nice banana flavor because you use banana pudding mix when you make them. And then, just like a banana split, they include maraschino cherries and sprinkles. I made these for Elayne‚Äôs birthday party on Saturday, and they were delicious! </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Since they use a cake mix as a base, these cookies are very quick and easy to make. No need to measure any flour or sugar. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/24/BananaSplitCookies/BananaSplitCookies6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
In a medium bowl, combine the cake mix and banana pudding mix. Add in the eggs, oil, and vanilla. Mix until all ingredients are combined. The dough will be very thick. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/24/BananaSplitCookies/BananaSplitCookies5.jpg" class="floating-image">

</div>

<p>Next, stir in the chocolate chips. Then gently fold in the chopped cherries and sprinkles. </p>

<div style="display:flex;">
Scoop the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 9-10 minutes, until the cookies begin to turn golden brown.

Are you a fan of banana pudding? Have it in the form of cheesecake for a rich, delicious dessert. 

<br>

</a>

<p>I made this cheesecake to take over to my parents‚Äô house for Thanksgiving a couple years ago. It was just a couple months after Elayne was born, and I hadn‚Äôt had much time to bake. So I really wanted to try something new and different. And my in-laws were in town helping with Elayne, so it was a good time to do it. </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt usually make many cheesecakes. Up until a few years ago, I actually wasn‚Äôt a big fan of cheesecake. But my husband really likes it, and it has grown on me. And since Tommy isn‚Äôt big on many desserts, I wanted to make something that he would eat too. Plus, how can you go wrong with banana pudding? </p>
<p>It was a little more time-consuming, as most cheesecakes are. But definitely worth the extra effort. </p>
<p>You need to start by making the crust. Crush up the vanilla wafers, and combine them with the melted butter, sugar, and salt. Once the crust ingredients are all mixed together, press them into the bottom of a springform pan. Then, take the whole vanilla wafers, and place them around the rim of the pan. The wafers do like to fall over easily, so I had to gently push them down into the crust a little to help them stay up. Once the wafers are all in place, bake the crust at 350¬∞F for 8-10 minutes, until it‚Äôs lightly golden. Set the crust aside while you make the cheesecake filling. </p>
<p>To make the cheesecake filling, place the cream cheese and sugar in the bowl of a stand mixer. Cream these together until they form a smooth consistency. Next, add the sour cream and vanilla. Mix well until all ingredients are incorporated. Then, add in the eggs, one at a time, and mixing between each addition. </p>
<p>Pour half of the cheesecake filling in the springform pan. Top the filling with the chopped vanilla wafers and sliced bananas. Then pour the remaining cheesecake filling into the pan. </p>
<p>Wrap the bottom of the pan with aluminum foil. Then place the springform pan into a larger pan. Pour hot water into the larger pan, about ¬æ-inches deep. The reason we do this is because the added moisture will help prevent the cheesecake from drying out and cracking. </p>
<p>Next, bake the cheesecake for 60-70 minutes, until the center is almost set. When it is finished baking, the center will still jiggle slightly, but the edges will be set. Remove the cheesecake from the oven. Then, very carefully run a knife around the edge of the pan to loosen the cake from the edges. Don‚Äôt release the springform pan yet. Just loosen the edges, and allow the cake to cool to room temperature for about an hour. After the cake has cooled, cover it and place it in the refrigerator for at least 6 hours to set fully. </p>
<p>Once the cake has fully chilled, you can add the toppings and decorate! First, we need to make the whipped cream. I highly recommend making the whipped cream and decorating as close to serving time as possible. I know this isn‚Äôt always feasible when taking dessert to someone else‚Äôs house. But the reason I recommend this is because the whipped cream will deflate over time. So if the decorated cake has been sitting in the fridge for a few hours, it may not look quite as pretty once it‚Äôs time to be served. But it‚Äôll taste delicious either way!! </p>
<p>For the whipped cream, pour the heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer. I like the chill the bowl in the freezer for a little bit first. I find the keeping the cream as cold as possible will help it form into a nice, thick whipped cream. Add the powdered sugar to the cream. With a whisk attachment fitted to your mixer, mix on medium-high speed for about 2 minutes, or until stiff peaks form. When bakers say ‚Äúuntil stiff peaks form‚Äù, this is what we mean: When you lift your whisk out of the cream, it‚Äôll naturally peak up where the whisk was lifted out. If that peak holds shape and does not sink back into the cream, that is a stiff peak, and your whipped cream is ready. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Now you get to decorate! I recommend spooning the whipped cream into a pastry bag fitted with a large and pretty tip. This way, you can pipe the whipped cream in swirls or other pretty designs. However, if you don't have a pastry bag and decorating tips, or if you're short on time, you could always just spoon the cream into little globs on the cake, or you could spread a layer of whipped cream on top like a frosting. Finally, place vanilla wafers on top and drizzle with caramel sauce. You can choose to decorate in any way you like. I chose to do little swirls of whipped cream around the perimeter of the cake, and then I placed a vanilla wafer at the edge of each swirl. And then I decided that the middle looked too bare, so I added a larger swirl of whipped cream in the middle. Then I drizzled caramel sauce over the entire cake. I think it turned out pretty well üòä

    <title>Apple Pie</title>

A classic apple pie should be a staple in every recipe book.
<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>In my family, we typically only make apple pie for Thanksgiving, and we do have it at every Thanksgiving. The holiday just doesn‚Äôt seem complete without it. </p>
<p>This recipe is a simple apple pie; no streusel topping or anything fancy. But it does have a delicious cinnamon and sugar mixture coating the apples and on top of the crust. It‚Äôs a timeless pie, and perfect for any occasion. </p>
<p>The recipe is straight-forward, and you don‚Äôt have to worry about making the pie crust from scratch. I always just use a refrigerated pie crust from the grocery store. First thing, slice the apples. I always peel them first. I am not a fan of having the skin on a baked apple. And I slice the apples pretty thin, and cut each slice into smaller pieces. I find it easier to eat the pie if everything is already bite-sized instead of needing to cut through the apples while eating. </p>
<p>Next, grease a 9-inch pie dish. Flour one side of one pie crust, and place it floured-side down in the pie dish. Mold the sides to form to the pan. Next, beat the egg white until it‚Äôs bubbly. Use a pastry brush to spread half of the egg white on the bottom and sides of the crust (the rest will be used later). The reason we use an egg white wash is to prevent the filling from seeping into the crust and creating a soggy crust. The egg white acts as a water-proof barrier. </p>
<p>Mix the cinnamon and sugar in a small dish. I use a 6-to-1 sugar to cinnamon ratio. If you want more cinnamon sugar mixture, you can increase the amounts while still keeping the ratio. Sprinkle the cinnamon&#x2F;sugar over the sliced apples and mix them well. Then add the pinch of nutmeg. Pour the apples into the prepared crust. Then, place small dabs of butter around the top of the apples. Supposedly, adding butter to fruit-filled pies helps to prevent the fruit‚Äôs juices from bubbling over and creating a messy-looking pie. Also, the butter helps to add some richness to the filling. </p>
<p>Place the second crust on top of your apples and butter. Pinch and seal all of the edges, so that the filling does not come out. Then, trim the excess crust around the edges. Spread the remaining half of the egg white on top of the crust. Having the egg wash on top gives the crust a golden and polished look, making it look more appetizing. It also helps to make sugar stick. Sprinkle some more cinnamon and sugar on top of the crust. Finally, use a knife to cut a few small slits in the top crust. Doing this allows steam to escape while the pie is baking. If we didn‚Äôt make these cuts, the steam would build up and cause the crust to become soggy. </p>
<p>Bake the pie for about 1 hour, or until the top looks nice and golden. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
You may notice that my pie has 2 stick figures on it. There is a story to that... 
One Thanksgiving when I was young, my sisters and I were helping my mom make the apple pie. She had already trimmed off the excess dough from the top crust. For some reason, my sisters and I started talking about decorating the pie, making it Thanksgiving-themed. And so we decided the pie needed a pilgrim and Indian. So I set about making them. But let's be real, I'm not an artist. And trying to cut figures out of dough isn't easy. So I ended up with stick figures. I also cut out a pilgrim hat and a feather for the Indian. None of us could stop laughing. It then became a running joke that every year, the apple pie needed the pilgrim and Indian, or it just wasn't a real Thanksgiving. So, to this day, I still decorate my pie every year. üòÑ

This Berry Icebox Cake is a light and refreshing treat for a hot summer day.

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<div style="display:flex;">
What I love about this recipe is how easy it is to make. You don't even need an oven. Also, it's a perfect summer dessert. During the hot summer days, you don't always want something as rich and decadent as chocolate. I mean, I love chocolate as much as the next person, but occasionally I want something different and lighter. So the icebox cake is perfect for those occasions. Tommy, who isn't big on sweets, even said he really liked it and that I should make it again in the future. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/04/BerryIceboxCake/BerryIceboxCake10.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>I will say, next time I make this, I will make a few changes. It didn‚Äôt turn out quite as well as I had hoped. It was absolutely delicious, but it didn‚Äôt look as pretty as I had hoped. But I have thought about what I would do differently, and I will mention all the changes below. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
So, what do we do first? 
Make sure your cream cheese is fully softened. Beat the cream cheese and the dry pudding mixes together until they are blended and smooth. I used a stand mixer, but next time, I think it will be better to use a hand mixer. The beaters on the hand mixer will help to make the mixer smoother. This time, I ended up with some small clumps of pudding that didn't get broken up, so my pudding wasn't very smooth. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/04/BerryIceboxCake/BerryIceboxCake8.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, gradually beat in the milk. You want to add just a little milk at a time, beating between each addition, until all the milk is mixed in. If you try pouring all the milk in at once, it will slosh everywhere when you turn the mixer on. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/04/BerryIceboxCake/BerryIceboxCake7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, fold in 8 ounces of the cool whip by hand. Leave the remaining 4 ounces for the next step. Make sure it is thawed fully. If it‚Äôs still partially frozen, you‚Äôll end up with clumps of cool whip in your mixture.<br>Now that your pudding mixture is ready, it‚Äôs time to assemble your cake. I had my little helper with me again today. And by ‚Äúhelp‚Äù, I mean that Elayne ate a bunch of blueberries and tried to get into the pudding. üòä So anyways, start by spreading the remaining 4 ounces of cool whip into the bottom of a 9x13-inch pan. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/07/04/BerryIceboxCake/BerryIceboxCake6.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, add a layer of graham crackers to the pan. Break them up as needed in order to cover the entire pan. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/04/BerryIceboxCake/BerryIceboxCake5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Now add a layer of pudding on top of your graham crackers, and then top it with a layer of blueberries and strawberries. I will say that you should determine how many berries you have in order to know how many to put. I ended up putting too many berries in the middle of the cake, and then didn't have enough leftover to make the top look pretty. (This could also be in part to Elayne eating all my berries üòÇ)
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/04/BerryIceboxCake/BerryIceboxCake4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Repeat the layers of graham crackers, pudding, and berries two more times. So you should end up with three layers of each. After all the layers are in, your pan should be mostly full. Put your pan in the fridge to chill for at least 4 hours. I left mine overnight. This gives the pudding time to set, and it lets the graham crackers get soft.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/04/BerryIceboxCake/BerryIceboxCake3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Right before you are ready to serve your dessert, melt the white chocolate chips in the microwave. Be careful not to burn the chocolate. It is very easy to do. Just a few seconds too long in the microwave and your chocolate gets hard and dry. Anyways, when I melted the chocolate, I got it smooth and melted, but it was still pretty thick, which meant I couldn‚Äôt drizzle it onto the dessert very easily. So it didn‚Äôt look great. But, I did a little research, and you can add just a little vegetable oil or canola oil to your chocolate while it‚Äôs melting to make it thinner and easier to drizzle. I‚Äôm going to try that next time. So once your white chocolate is melted, drizzle it on top of the berries as best as you can, and now you‚Äôre ready to eat! </p>

<p>These Caramel Rolls are a fun, exciting take on a delicious treat. They would be a perfect addition to a breakfast or brunch. Or they serve well as a yummy dessert. </p>
<p>They look very impressive, especially since you invert the entire plate onto a serving platter. But they are very quick and easy to make. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating your oven to 375¬∞F. Grease a 9-inch pie plate. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/03/03/CaramelRolls/CaramelRolls1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>In a small pan over medium heat, combine the brown sugar, butter, corn syrup, and milk. Cook and stir until the mixture is all blended together. Then pour the mixture into the prepared pie plate. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Separate each crescent roll dough into 2 rectangles, so that you have 4 rectangles in total. Seal the perforations together so that the rectangles do not have any holes in them. In a small bowl, combine the sugar and cinnamon. Sprinkle the cinnamon/sugar mixture over the crescent roll dough. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/03/03/CaramelRolls/CaramelRolls2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Starting with a long side of each dough rectangle, roll up the dough. Cut each roll into 8-9 pieces. Place the pieces into the caramel-filled pie plate.</p>

This Chicken Avocado Crescent Ring is a delicious and filling appetizer, perfect for any party. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>Last night, we had some of Tommy‚Äôs coworkers over to hang out and play games. So, of course, I spent way too much time planning and cooking, and made way too much food, as per my usual üòä </p>
<p>I had never met any of Tommy‚Äôs coworkers, and so I really wanted to make a good impression. I think I did pretty well. Everyone raved over the food, which made me feel really good. </p>
<p>When I make food for parties, I always try to have a good variety of foods. I have some lighter foods and some heavier, more filling foods. This Chicken Avocado Crescent Ring fell into the more filling category. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
It was pretty easy to make, and there was very little left over at the end of the night, so I think it was enjoyed. Start by preheating the oven to 375¬∞F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. If you don't have parchment paper, you could grease the baking sheet. But for something like this, I think parchment paper works better. When greasing a pan, it's easy to miss a spot and have your food stick. And you really don't want your crescent ring to stick to the pan and break while trying to put it on a serving tray. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/13/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Place an oven-safe bowl in the middle of the baking sheet. Unroll the crescent roll dough, placing the triangles to overlap each other w/ the bowl in the center. When I made this, I placed the bowl upside-down. Turns out, this was a mistake. It was very difficult to remove the bowl from the middle without breaking the ring after it was done baking. I did manage it, but it could have been much easier. So next time, I'll be placing the bowl upright. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/13/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Sprinkle half of the shredded cheese around the base of the ring. Place the diced chicken and avocado over the cheese. Then, sprinkle the remaining cheese and bacon over the top of the chicken and avocado. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/08/13/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing2.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/08/13/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing3.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Roll the narrow end of each triangle over, tucking the end underneath. This will help to seal the dough so that the ring does not fall apart when being transferred to a serving platter.<br>In a small bowl, beat the egg. Brush the egg over the top of the ring. Sprinkle with sea salt.</p>

    <img src="/2023/08/13/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing/ChickenAvocadoCrescentRing5.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<br>
<div style="display:flex;">
Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the crescent ring turns golden brown. 
While it's baking, prepare the dipping sauce by combining the ranch, basil, garlic powder, and minced onion in a small bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well-combined. 
When the ring is finished baking, allow it to cool for a couple minutes on the pan. Then transfer it to a serving platter, and place the dipping sauce in a bowl in the middle.

    <title>Banana Pudding Cookies</title>

Banana pudding in cookie form?! That's right! These cookies are so rich in banana flavor, and they are so easy to make!
<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>I recently made these cookies for a ladies night I attended. One of the women asked me, ‚ÄúHow many bananas did you have to put in this to get so much banana flavor?‚Äù My answer: None. Instead of using fresh bananas, this recipe uses banana pudding mix. Pudding mixes are a wonderful way to add lots of flavor without complicating the recipe. </p>
<p>What I love about this recipe, apart from the simplicity, is that you really do get all the flavors of banana pudding within the cookie. The strong banana flavor comes from the pudding mix. But the cookies also contain white chocolate, which brings the creaminess you‚Äôd find in banana pudding. And there are even chunks of vanilla wafers, so you get the nice crunch too. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
This recipe calls for butter shortening. If you're not sure what this is, it can be found in the baking aisle of your grocery store, near the Crisco and cooking spray. It is a butter flavored shortening; I buy Crisco brand, but there may be others out there. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/04/23/BananaPuddingCookies/ButterCrisco.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>To make these cookies, start by creaming together the shortening, butter, sugars, vanilla, and eggs. This is most easily done using an electric stand mixer. Once these ingredients are all combined fully, the dry ingredients need to be added. I always find it best to mix the dry ingredients in a separate bowl. Then, add a scoop of dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and allow the dry to start to incorporate before adding more. This prevents flour from flying up out of the bowl. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Next, we need to chop the vanilla wafers. I just used a cutting board and knife, and made medium-sized cookie pieces. I would recommend not using a food processor, because it will make more crumbs and less cookie pieces. Once the vanilla wafers are chopped, stir in the wafers and white chocolate chips. I like to do this part by hand so that the cookies don't break up even more. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/04/23/BananaPuddingCookies/BananaPuddingCookies1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, roll the dough into 1 or 1¬Ω inch balls and place them on a greased baking sheet. A lot of time, I like to roll the balls by hand, because then I can control the amount of wafers and white chocolate. You don‚Äôt want a cookie that is majority white chocolate. But the dough is very sticky, so just be prepared for messy hands. Alternately, you could use cookie scoops. These allow for more consistently sized cookies, but it‚Äôs more difficult to control the white chocolate to wafer to cookie ratio.</p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Place the dough balls on a greased baking sheet, and bake for 9 minutes. The cookies will look very underdone, but they will firm up a little as they cool. I find it best to pull cookies out of the oven when they look underdone because we want nice, chewy cookies. And, even after removing them from the oven, cookies will continue to bake a little, because the pan is still hot. This is why it is always recommended to let cookies cool on the pan for just a minute or two, and then remove them to cool completely.

<p>This past weekend, Tommy and I actually had free time! Elayne spent the entire weekend with her grandparents. That means Tommy and I were actually able to make evening plans with friends! </p>
<p>We had a friend come over to play some board games in the afternoon, and then we all met a couple other friends for dinner. So, of course, I wanted to do some baking before people came over! </p>
<p>I decided to make these Chocolate Caramel Espresso Bars, which proved to be rich, indulgent, and delicious! They consist of a layer of graham cracker crust, a layer of smooth caramel, and finally a layer of rich chocolate espresso ganache. This dessert is not very difficult to make, but it is a little  more time consuming, simply because you need to let each layer cool before adding the next. </p>
<p>We start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. Line an 8x8 pan with foil. Lightly spray it with cooking spray. </p>

<p>Then, we need to make the graham cracker crust. Combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter in a bowl and mix well. Press this mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes, then allow to cool slightly.</p>

    <img src="/2023/01/14/ChocCaramelEspressoBars/ChocCaramelEspressoBar4.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Next, we need to make the caramel. In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream, butter, brown sugar, and water. Over medium heat, stir until all ingredients are combined and the mixture is smooth. Then, increase the heat to high, and allow the mixture to boil, without stirring, for 5-7 minutes. Remove the caramel from heat, and carefully pour the caramel onto the graham cracker crust. Allow the pan to sit for 20 minutes to cool. Then, freeze until the caramel is firm, at least 30 minutes.</p>

    <img src="/2023/01/14/ChocCaramelEspressoBars/ChocCaramelEspressoBar7.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Now we need to make the ganache. Combine the chocolate chips and heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat for 30 seconds at a time then stir, repeating until the mixture is smooth. Then mix in the espresso powder. Pour the chocolate ganache over the chilled caramel. Sprinkle sea salt on top. Allow the dessert to chill in the freezer for about 2 hours, until firm.</p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/01/14/ChocCaramelEspressoBars/ChocCaramelEspressoBar9.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Once the dessert has been chilled enough, remove from the freezer and cut into bars. Because this dessert is so rich, I recommend cutting it into about 25 squares, instead of large bars. Now you‚Äôre ready to enjoy!! </p>

    <title>Chocolate Caramel Shortbread Bars</title>

<div class="post-body">
I have recently grown to love shortbread, especially when paired with something extra sweet like caramel or chocolate. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>These Chocolate Caramel Shortbread Bars are rich and indulgent. They are the perfect treat. The shortbread prevents the caramel and chocolate from being too sickeningly sweet, and provides the perfect crumbly texture. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
They are easy to make, and they don't require too many ingredients. I did have to run to the grocery store to buy some caramels and heavy cream, because these are ingredients I don't usually keep around the house. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/06/23/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating your oven to 350¬∞F, and grease a 9x13 inch with cooking spray. 
In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the butter, powdered sugar, sugar, and vanilla. Beat until these ingredients are all well combined.

<p>I had my little helper working with me today. And by ‚Äúhelp‚Äù, I mean that she ate a bunch of the chocolate chips and almost spilled all the flour on the floor üòÇ<br>But she loves to try to help, and she is fascinated by watching the mixer. When she gets a little older, I‚Äôm hoping we‚Äôll actually be able to bake together. Ever since I decided I wanted to have kids of my own, I have looked forward to baking cookies and other treats with them. I want to share my passion with them, and I hope they‚Äôll enjoy it too. </p>

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Ok, back to the shortbread: Next, gradually add in the flour, mixing between each addition. It is important to do this slowly - if you try to add all the flour at once, it will go everywhere when you turn on the mixer! Trust me, I've made this mistake more than once. 
Once all the flour is in, mix until it is just incorporated. The shortbread dough will be crumbly. This is expected. It should hold form when it is pressed together. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/06/23/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Press about half of the shortbread dough into the bottom of the prepared 9x13 inch pan. Bake this base for 25 minutes, until the dough is golden. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/06/23/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars16.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
While the shortbread base is baking, add the caramels and heavy cream in a pan on the stove. Heat on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the caramel is fully melted and the mixture is smooth. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/06/23/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Pour the melted caramel over the shortbread base. Make sure to spread it all the way to the edges. Then, sprinkle the chocolate chips over the caramel layer. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/06/23/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars8.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Finally, take small handfuls of the remaining shortbread dough. Press each handful between your palms to flatten it. Place the flattened piece of dough on top of the chocolate layer. Repeat until all the remaining dough is used, making sure to cover as much of the chocolate layer with dough as possible. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/06/23/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars/ChocCaramelShortbreadBars9.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Bake the shortbread bars for 30-35 minutes, until the top is a nice golden brown color. Remove from the oven, and allow the shortbread to cool completely before cutting and serving. </p>

If you're looking for a super easy and delicious treat, look no further.

<p>This Chocolate Caramel Pretzel Bark is satisfyingly salty and sweet. And it is one of the easiest recipes you will ever make. Plus, it is completely addicting. I could easily stand there just munching on it all night if I didn‚Äôt stop myself. </p>
<br>
You don't need many ingredients... or many baking skills for that matter. Start by preheating the oven to 325¬∞F. Then, line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Grease the foil with cooking spray. This will prevent the caramel from sticking to the pan and the foil. Then place pretzels on the baking sheet in a single layer, covering the entire sheet. 
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/07/13/ChocCaramelPretzelBark/ChocCaramelPretzelBark1.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/07/13/ChocCaramelPretzelBark/ChocCaramelPretzelBark8.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Honestly, the most difficult part of this recipe is the fact that you have to use the stove. In a small pot, melt the butter and brown sugar over medium-low heat until it comes to a boil. Allow the mixture to boil, stirring almost continuously for 3-4 minutes. Once it is finished boiling, pour the caramel mixture over the layer of pretzels. The caramel will spread out some as it bakes, so it‚Äôs ok if the caramel doesn‚Äôt cover every inch of pretzel. I will say, next time I make this, I will probably use a just slightly smaller baking sheet. I think it would have been just a little better if more of the pretzels were covered by the caramel. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/07/13/ChocCaramelPretzelBark/ChocCaramelPretzelBark9.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Bake the pretzel bark for 8-10 minutes. The caramel will be very bubbly. Remove the pan from the oven and sprinkle the chocolate chips over the entire sheet. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/07/13/ChocCaramelPretzelBark/ChocCaramelPretzelBark5.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Return the baking sheet to the oven for another 1-2 minutes, until the chocolate gets soft and melty. Remove the bark from the oven. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate in an even layer, covering all the pretzels and caramel. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/13/ChocCaramelPretzelBark/ChocCaramelPretzelBark7.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Once all the chocolate is spread out evenly, place the baking sheet in the freezer for at least 30 minutes. This will allow the chocolate and caramel to harden. Once it is fully hardened and set, remove bark from the baking sheet, and peel off the aluminum foil. Break the bark into pieces.

    <title>Chocolate Covered Banana Pudding Cups</title>

I never used to be a big fan of banana pudding, but recently I have grown to love it. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<br>
<br>
But these banana pudding cups are even better, because they have all the yumminess of banana pudding, but also chocolate! If you ask me, chocolate can make everything better. 
<br>Bad day? Chocolate.
<br>Stressed? Chocolate. 
<br>Have a migraine? Eat some chocolate. (And go to sleep with an ice pack on your head - tip from an expert üòâ)

<p>The point is, the chocolate fudge sauce in these cups only adds to the deliciousness and also helps to distinguish your dessert from someone else‚Äôs banana pudding. </p>
<p>These are very easy to make, and also very impressive looking. Sometimes in baking, presentation is just as important as taste (well‚Ä¶almost). </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
So, what do we do? 
First, we need to prepare the pudding. We start with a box of instant vanilla pudding. Prepare it according to the package directions. I like to use the instant pudding that is ready to eat in 5 minutes. All you have to do is stir together the pudding mix with 2 cups of cold milk. Whisk it for about 2 minutes, and it will thicken up and be ready to eat.

Now, you need the cups that you plan on using for your dessert. I like to use the ones pictured to the right, because I think they are really pretty, and they are a good size glass for dessert. But you could also use wine glasses, martini glasses, small bowls, whatever you have on hand. 
<div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Now, all you have to do is assemble your cups. I started with some fudge sauce on the bottom. They I added vanilla wafers (I broke them up into 2-3 pieces so that they‚Äôd be easier to eat with a spoon). Banana slices came next. I did about 3 banana slices in each cup. But if your glass is wider than mine, you may want to do more. Then I added a layer of the prepared vanilla pudding. Repeat all of those layers as needed until your glass is almost full. You want to leave a little room at the top for some garnishes. I ended up only doing all of the layers twice. If your glass is tall and narrow, you may need to do more. </p>
<p>Finally, top your dessert with a little more fudge sauce, whipped cream, a vanilla wafer, and a slice of banana. You can optionally also add some chopped peanuts to the top. </p>
<p>I would recommend serving your dessert immediately after adding the garnishes. However, I know this isn‚Äôt always feasible. When you are having people over, you usually try to get as much prep work done beforehand as possible. So, if you are preparing your dessert ahead of time, I would recommend adding the layers of fudge sauce, vanilla wafers, banana slices, and vanilla pudding to your glass. You can top with the extra fudge sauce. But then stop there. Do not add the whipped cream yet. I have made this mistake so many times. And I know better - I just add it before thinking. If you add the whipped cream early, and then stick your dessert in the fridge for later, the whipped cream will lose volume, and it will end up pretty flat and won‚Äôt look as appealing. So my recommendation is to prep up until the whipped cream, then add the whipped cream and the vanilla wafer and banana garnishes immediately before serving. </p>

Chocolate and peanut butter: a pairing as iconic as milk and cookies. These parfaits are the perfect dessert for when you want to make an impression.

<p>Chocolate and peanut butter please even those who don‚Äôt have a wide variety of food favorites, like many kids. But these parfaits can be enjoyed by adults and kids alike. Who doesn‚Äôt love a sweet treat after dinner? </p>
<p>I will say, they are a little tedious to make. Not difficult, it just takes a little while to make both the peanut butter and chocolate mousses, pipe them in layers in the cups, and then decorate the top. Another thing to note is that each mousse needs to sit in the refrigerator to set for at least an hour before it can be assembled into the cups. The last time I made these, I actually made the mousses the night before and left them to sit in the fridge overnight. The chocolate mousse did fine with that; it was still soft enough to be piped into the glasses. The peanut butter mousse, however, was a little too hard and crumbly. Not a big deal though. I simply microwaved it in 10 second intervals, stirring in between, until it was just soft enough to be piped into the glass. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
Now, I keep talking about piping the mousse. What does that mean? By this, I mean that I put the mousse into a pastry bag that has a cake decorating tip on it. Then the mousse is squeezed through the tip and into the serving glass. The cake decorating tips are those that are used to pipe frosting onto a cake in several different pretty designs. For these parfaits, I would recommend using tips with a larger opening. You can't be piping the mousses, especially the peanut butter mousse, through a tiny hole. 

<div>
    <img src="/2022/04/18/ChocPBParfait/PBChocParfait1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>The reason I used pastry bags and decorating tips is simply for the sake of the appearance. Piping the mousse resulted in a pretty design, as well as allowing me to keep even layers. </p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt have pastry bags and decorating tips, another option is the use Ziploc bags. You can simply add the mousse to a Ziploc bag, use scissors to cut off a small corner of the bag, and squeeze the mousse through the newly created hole. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
For the serving glasses, I used some pretty juice glasses that I had at home. You could also use wine glasses, or really any glass or bowl that you would like. With the size glass I used, I was able to get 6 parfaits. Pictured to the right are the glasses I used, including my hand as a size reference.

These chocolate crispy treats are rich, delicious, and so easy to make! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>We had my family over for dinner a couple weeks ago. And so of course, I wanted to make a dessert for the occasion. I made these treats, not really knowing how they would turn out. But, when these bars include Cocoa Puffs, Nutella, marshmallows, and chocolate chips, how could they possibly be anything but delicious?! </p>
<p>However, they turned out even better than expected! They are very chocolate-y, and rich and indulgent. And so addicting. My mom asked for the recipe, and she actually made them the following day when she had some friends over. And she said that all her friends loved them too. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
And, in addition to being delicious, these bars are also super easy to make. You make them in the same way you would Rice Krispy treats. Start by greasing a 9x13-inch pan. Otherwise, your bars will stick to the pan, and you'll have a big mess trying to get them out. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/09/03/ChocolateCrispyTreats/ChocCrispyTreats6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Once it is fully melted, add 10 ounces of marshmallows (typically a full bag, depending on the brand of marshmallows you buy), and stir continuously until the marshmallows are all melted and smooth. Stir in the Nutella and vanilla until they are well combined. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Now, add the Cocoa Puffs, remaining marshmallows, chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips. Mix until all the dry ingredients are well coated with melted marshmallow. Finally, press the mixture into the greased 9x13-inch pan. If it's sticky and difficult to deal with, a good tip is to spray some grease on your hands to keep the marshmallows from sticking to them.

<div style="display:flex;">
Allow the bars to fully cool before cutting them and eating.

You know those chocolate oranges you can get around Christmas time? These cookies remind me of those. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>Chocolate oranges used to be one of my favorite parts about Christmas time. I received one in my stocking every year when I was little. It wasn‚Äôt Christmas without smashing a chocolate orange into the table to break apart. </p>
<p>I took these cookies to my friend‚Äôs birthday party over the weekend, and I got a lot of compliments. Chocolate and fruit is a great combination, and, maybe it‚Äôs just me, but I always feel a little classy when I make dessert with fruit in it. It just always seems a little fancier or something. </p>
<p>I like how the acidity of the orange help to cut some of the richness of the chocolate. It results in a nice balance that doesn‚Äôt make you feel too guilty for eating. So that means we can eat more, right? üòä</p>
<p>Start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. </p>
<p>In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Set this bowl aside until needed. </p>
<p>Wash and zest the orange. Using a stand mixer, beat together one cup of sugar with the softened butter, one tablespoon of orange zest, orange extract, and egg until well combined. </p>

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Then, gradually add the set aside flour mixture into the butter mixture, making sure to mix well between each addition. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/10/04/ChocolateOrangeCookies/ChocolateOrangeCookies4.jpg" class="floating-image">

</div>

<p>In a small bowl, combine the remaining sugar and orange zest. Scoop the cookie dough and roll into 1-inch balls. Roll the balls of dough in the sugar&#x2F;orange mixture, and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten the dough slightly with the palm of your hand. </p>

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Bake the cookies for 9-10 minutes, until the edges begin to harden. Allow the cookies to cool for a couple minutes before removing from the pan to cool completely.

This is one of the easiest recipes to throw together for a last-minute gathering. The most time-consuming part is washing and cutting all the fruit. But there are shortcuts for that too if you are in a hurry, or just not feeling like doing the work. You can find lots of fruits already washed and cut at your local grocery store.

<p>Make sure your cream cheese is nice and soft. This will make it easier to blend your ingredients together and get a really smooth dip. Combine all the dip ingredients into a large bowl. Use an electric hand mixer to beat the ingredients until the mixture is fully combined and smooth. For dips like this, I prefer the hand mixer, because I think it results in a smoother blend, but you are welcome to use a stand mixer as well. </p>

<p>Now your dip is ready to eat with the fruit of your choice! I personally liked strawberries with it the most. Strawberries with chocolate is just such a classic combination. I also liked pineapple, but that might also be because pineapple is my favorite fruit.<br>When I served my dip at our housewarming party last weekend, I wasn‚Äôt thinking about it too much when I bought the fruit. In addition to strawberries and pineapple, I also bought blueberries and raspberries. They were delicious with the dip, but they weren‚Äôt the easiest fruit for dipping. So I would recommend making your fruit choices wisely. </p>

Chocolate and orange is always a fun combination. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

</a>

<p>Ever since I was young, my parents would buy me a Chocolate Orange at Christmas. It‚Äôs the only time of year you can really find them. And I always loved them. These cookies remind me of that chocolate orange. The orange zest in the dough gives the cookie a subtle orange flavor that just seems to enhance the flavor of the chocolate. </p>
<p>I have made these cookies several times. Most recently I made them for my neighbor‚Äôs birthday, and I got a lot of compliments. What I really like about them is that they are a little different from your standard chocolate chip, sugar, peanut butter cookies, etc. </p>
<p>So how do we make these cookies? We need to start by making the dough. Once we make the dough, we need to let it chill in the fridge for a while, so we don‚Äôt need to preheat the oven yet. </p>
<p>First, cream together the butter, sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla on medium-high speed until it‚Äôs light and fluffy. Then, slowly add in the flour, mixing between each addition. Then, stir in 1 cup of chocolate chips and 2 tablespoons of orange zest. For this recipe, you only need about 1 medium-sized orange. From that orange, you should be able to get enough zest for both the dough and the garnish. </p>
<p>Once your dough is made, divide it in half. Then roll each half of the dough into a log shape, about 2 inches in diameter. Wrap the logs of dough in plastic wrap, and place them in the fridge to chill for at least 2 hours. Chilling the dough will prevent it from spreading too much in the oven. This way, we can end with thick, even cookies that we can easily dip in the chocolate. </p>
<p>After the dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 350¬∞F. Grease a baking sheet. Remove the dough from the fridge, and slice the logs into rounds about a ¬Ω-inch thick. Bake the cookies for 13-15 minutes, until the edges begin to turn golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool fully. </p>
<p>Once the cookies have fully cooled, melt the remaining cup of chocolate chips in the microwave until it‚Äôs smooth. Dip one end of each cookie into the chocolate, and place on a piece of wax paper to set. Before the chocolate sets, garnish with more orange zest and sea salt. Allow the cookies to sit until the chocolate is fully set. You can also put the cookies in the fridge if you‚Äôd like them to set more quickly. </p>

    <title>Chocolate Raspberry Tarts</title>

These Chocolate Raspberry Tarts are an exciting, delicious treat, with a creamy, chocolate ganache filling. 

<br>

<p>The raspberries add a nice tartness that balances out the richness of the chocolate. It‚Äôs also an impressive-looking dessert, if you‚Äôre looking to show off your skills. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Start by greasing your tart pan(s) with cooking spray. I used mini tart pans, but you can use a single large tart pan if you prefer. Set your prepared pans aside for later.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/07/ChocolateRaspberryTarts/ChocolateRaspberryTarts1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Add the flour, powdered sugar, and salt into the bowl of a food processor. Pulse it a few times to combine the ingredients. Chop the cold butter into small pieces, and add them to the food processor. Pulse until the butter is cut in.<br>Lightly beat the egg, and add it to the food processor. Pulse until the dough forms into a ball. The dough will be very sticky. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/09/07/ChocolateRaspberryTarts/ChocolateRaspberryTarts3.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
On a silicone mat or another greased surface, knead the dough a few times to make sure it is well-mixed. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/07/ChocolateRaspberryTarts/ChocolateRaspberryTarts4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Press the dough into the prepared tart pans. The dough should cover the bottom of the pans and go up the sides. Prick the dough several times with a fork. This will prevent the dough from bubbling up when it bakes. Freeze the dough for at least 30 minutes. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/07/ChocolateRaspberryTarts/ChocolateRaspberryTarts5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Preheat the oven to 375¬∞F. Butter some aluminum foil, and place it buttered-side-down over each tart crust. Place the tart pans on a baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes.<br>Remove the foil from the pans. Return to the oven and bake for an additional 10 minutes, until the crust is golden. Allow the crusts to cool fully. </p>

    <img src="/2023/09/07/ChocolateRaspberryTarts/ChocolateRaspberryTarts7.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, make the chocolate ganache filling. Pour the bittersweet chocolate chips into a heat-proof bowl. 
In a small pan, heat the heavy cream and vanilla over medium-low heat. Stir often, until the mixture is simmering. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/07/ChocolateRaspberryTarts/ChocolateRaspberryTarts9.jpg" class="floating-image">

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Then pour the hot cream mixture over the chocolate chips. Stir until the chocolate is all melted and smooth. Then add the softened butter to the chocolate. Mix well until fully incorporated.

Pour the chocolate ganache into the cooled crusts. Spread it so that it is smooth. Then top it with the raspberries, and sprinkle with powdered sugar.

Chocolate Chip Cookies: The simplest and yet most satisfying cookie of all time. 
<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>For such a simple and common cookie, Chocolate Chip is always a crowd-pleaser. These cookies have both the satisfying sweet dough that makes the perfect cookie base, but then when you add chocolate, it can only improve. Because it is not over-the-top sweet, these cookies pair nicely with everything: milk, coffee, other cookies üòâ</p>
<p>The recipe is pretty simple. All you need is butter, butter flavored shortening, sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, eggs, all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, and of course, yummy chocolate chips. I like to use mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, but any will do perfectly.<br>The butter flavored shortening can be found near the Crisco in the baking aisle of the grocery store. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
When I was growing up, my mom always baked chocolate chip cookies using her Pampered Chef stone baking sheet. It's funny the things we pick up from our parents. Because of this, I always bake my chocolate chip cookies using a stone baking sheet. But I don't usually think about baking other cookies on stone... You can choose to bake these cookies on a stone baking sheet, or just use your favorite one. They should turn out great either way.
<div>
    <img src="/2022/04/12/ChocolateChipCookies/ButterCrisco.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>The recipe is simple to make. Start with your softened butter and butter shortening. Cream these together in a stand mixture until they are well combined. Then, add in the sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla. Mix until it is smooth. Next, add in the eggs, and mix again. </p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add these dry ingredients to your butter mixture, mixing between each addition. </p>
<p>Finally, stir in the chocolate chips by hand. Spoon the dough onto the baking sheet and bake for 9-11 minutes. Allow the cookies to sit on the pan for 1-2 minutes before removing to cool completely. </p>

<p>I grew up making these Chocolate Pudding Cakes with my mom. They were a staple for our holiday baking. When I was younger, I didn‚Äôt like them much, only because the glaze contained nuts, and I was determined that nuts ruined desserts. But they were continuously part of our traditional baking, and I eventually grew to love them. </p>
<p>These cakes are rich and sweet, and with the glaze soaking through them, they are very moist. Heat it up a little in the microwave and eat it with some ice cream. You can‚Äôt go wrong. </p>
<p>Whenever I bake these cakes, I always use mini bundt pans and make individual cakes. This makes it easier to give for the holidays, and it also makes this a good party dessert. But you can also make a single larger cake using a tube pan. </p>
<p>The recipe is simple. It involves a yellow cake mix and a package of instant chocolate pudding. Sounds delicious, right? </p>

These chocolate snickerdoodles are a very rich treat. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>I like this recipe because these cookies are pretty simple, not a lot of extra ingredients added in, but they are a little different than some other cookies you‚Äôll see. They aren‚Äôt your typical chocolate chip cookies, sugar cookies, peanut butter cookies, or ordinary snickerdoodles. They aren‚Äôt difficult to make either. But you do have to account for some time to chill the dough. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
So, where do we start? 
First, melt the unsweetened chocolate, then set the bowl aside to cool. I used Baker's chocolate, which worked out perfectly because it is exactly 4 ounces. But any unsweetened chocolate will be fine. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/08/19/ChocolateSnickerdoodles/BakingChocolate.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, cream together the butter and sugar using a stand mixer. Once finished, it should be smooth. Then, add the eggs, vanilla, and cooled, melted chocolate. Mix again until all ingredients are combined. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Next, in a separate bowl, combine the flour, cream of tartar, cocoa powder, baking soda, baking powder, and salt. Then the flour mixture needs to be added in to the butter/sugar mixture. As with all cookie doughs, the flour should be added in slowly. If you just dump all the flour into the mixer and turn it on, flour will fly everywhere. It makes a huge mess. I usually take a ¬º cup measuring cup and get a scoop of flour, mix it in, then add another scoop of flour and mix. I continue this until all the flour is mixed in. The dough will be pretty thick once all the flour is in. Set the dough in the fridge to chill for about 2 hours. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/08/19/ChocolateSnickerdoodles/ChocSnickerdoodle1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
After the dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 350¬∞F. Grease your baking sheet with some cooking spray. Then mix the remaining ‚Öì cup of sugar and 1¬Ω tablespoons of cinnamon in a small bowl. Scoop out your dough and roll it into the cinnamon/sugar mixture before placing on the baking sheet. Keep the remaining cinnamon/sugar for later - don't throw it away yet. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/08/19/ChocolateSnickerdoodles/ChocSnickerdoodle2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Bake the cookies for 12 minutes, or until the edges just begin to crack. Pull the cookies out of the oven. While they are still warm, sprinkle some of the remaining cinnamon/sugar mixture onto the top of the cookies.

    <title>Cinnamon Cookies</title>

These cinnamon cookies are a simple, delicious dessert that isn't too sweet.

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>I have made these cookies several times, and every time I have received compliments. They are very simple, no over-the-top ingredients. The cinnamon flavor is pretty mild, so even people who aren‚Äôt big on cinnamon can usually enjoy them. They are an easy cookie to have for any occasion where you‚Äôre unsure what everyone will like. </p>
<p>And they can be enjoyed with pretty much any food. Want a breakfast cookie? Coffee and cinnamon go great together üòÑ </p>
<p>These cookies are also very easy to make. You don‚Äôt need too many ingredients. Everything you need will typically be found in any baker‚Äôs pantry. First, preheat the oven to 325¬∞F, and grease your baking sheet. </p>
<p>Melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Cream together the melted butter and sugar. Then, add in the egg and vanilla; stir until all ingredients are combined. </p>
<p>In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, and baking powder. Slowly add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, mixing between each addition. When I say to slowly add the flour, I usually add about ¬º cup of flour at a time, and mix until it is mostly incorporated before adding more flour. I repeat this until all the flour is in. The reason I do this is to keep from making a mess. Have you ever tried to just dump the entire amount of flour in at once and turned on the mixer? Flour goes everywhere! Not a fun mess to clean up. </p>
<p>Once all the flour is in, set the dough in the fridge to chill for 10-15 minutes. Allowing cookie dough to chill before baking prevents the dough from spreading too much in the oven. This way, you can end up with nice, thick cookies. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
After the dough has chilled, roll out the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 9 minutes, or until the cookies are just slightly set. Remove the cookies from the oven. While the cookies are still hot, use a spoon to gently press on the center of each cookie. This step is not strictly necessary, but it gives the cookies their sunken-in shape, which I like.

    <title>Coconut Oatmeal Cookies</title>

These coconut oatmeal cookies have a delicious yet subtle coconut flavor to them, while also providing the texture of an oatmeal cookie.  
<br>
<span id="more"></span>

</a>

<p>I will admit, these cookies are some of my favorites, mostly because I have such good memories associated with them. These are the cookies I baked to be favors at our wedding. They seemed to be the perfect cookies for the occasion. Although he doesn‚Äôt have a sweet tooth, my husband does like coconut. And of course, I just love cookies in general. These cookies are nice and chewy; if you like crispy cookies, you‚Äôre wrong üòä The coconut made the cookies feel summer-y, and the oatmeal was a nice complement. Also, with having an outdoor June wedding, it was crucial that the cookies not include chocolate, as it would just melt and become all messy. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
I received so many compliments about the cookies that day. Some of my husband's relatives, who I had never met until that day, were raving about them, and it just made me feel so good! And now, every time I make the cookies, I think about our wedding day, and all the love I felt that day. 
<div>
    
</div>
</div>

<p>These coconut oatmeal cookies are very easy to make. The one part that I never enjoyed very much is measuring the coconut oil. No matter how hard I try, I always end up with coconut oil all over my hands! For this recipe, we measure the coconut oil solid. I use a spoon and scoop spoonfuls into a measuring cup until I have the right amount. Then, I transfer the oil to a bowl and heat it in the microwave to melt, then let it cool slightly. The oil needs to be melted so that it can be easily incorporated with the sugars, but we don‚Äôt want it too hot, or it could end up starting to cook the eggs! </p>
<p>Other than the measuring of the coconut oil, the rest of the recipe is just like any other cookie: Cream the oil and sugars, add the dry ingredients, and bake. </p>
<p>Optionally, you can also add some chocolate to these cookies. If desired, simply stir in about a cup of chocolate chips to your dough. Because we were outdoors in the summer, I didn‚Äôt add chocolate to the cookies for our wedding. But, since then, I have made them with chocolate included. I honestly like them both ways. </p>

Do you want a really easy and delicious appetizer? This is it! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Whether you‚Äôre the type of host who likes to make all the food from scratch (like me), or you‚Äôre just needing to throw something together before a few friends come over, this dip will be perfect for you. </p>
<p>We were having a couple friends over to watch an Atlanta United game one night. We had planned to just order some pizza and make it a very simple, casual night. But, of course, I figured it would be good to have a little appetizer before the pizza. And I was right üòä </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
It was sooo easy to make, and since it's served cold, I was able to make it ahead of time and just pull it out the fridge when our friends arrived. And it doesn't require too many ingredients either. Everyone loved it! My friends even asked for the recipe so that they could make it at home. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/08/21/CobbDip/CobbDip1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Here‚Äôs how you make it:<br>First, use a hand mixer to beat together the cream cheese, sour cream, and Ranch mix until they are well combined and the mixture is smooth. Spread this mixture into the bottom of a pie dish (or really, any medium-sized serving dish will work). </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2022/08/21/CobbDip/CobbDip3.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Then you'll need to chop up your Romaine lettuce, and layer it on top of your Ranch mixture. I chopped up the lettuce pretty small, in order to make it easier to eat. Anytime I order a salad at a restaurant, it always bugs me when they give me giant pieces of lettuce that I can't even fit in my mouth. So same principle applies here. Nice and small pieces of lettuce will be much easier to eat.
<div>
    <img src="/2022/08/21/CobbDip/CobbDip4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Finally, layer the rest of your toppings. After the lettuce, add the diced tomato, corn, cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and bleu cheese. For the corn, I like to use the fire roasted frozen corn that I find at Whole Foods. You can see it in the picture of all the needed ingredients above. I used this corn, put it in a glass bowl with a little water, and microwaved it so that it was no longer frozen. However, any corn you want to use is fine. If you‚Äôre feeling ambitious, you can grill some corn. Or, if you‚Äôre in a hurry, or can‚Äôt find the fire roasted corn, you can buy any other frozen corn. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Once all your layers are added, you're ready to eat! I like to serve this dip with tortilla chips. But I'm sure it would be delicious with crackers or other chips as well.

    <title>Coffee Cake Doughnuts</title>

<div class="post-body">
How could you not love coffee cake, especially when it has a delicious crumbly streusal topping? How about it we combine that with a doughnut?!

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>Today I decided to make both these Coffee Cake Doughnuts and some <a href="/2023/06/05/GlazedDoughnuts/" title="Glazed Doughnuts">Glazed Doughnuts</a>. I think they both turned out pretty damn well.</p>
<p>Just like the Glazed Doughnuts, these Coffee Cake Doughnuts are baked instead of fried. So they are more dense, like a cake, instead of being fluffy and airy like doughnuts you‚Äôd get from Krispy Kreme. But they have a delicious crumb topping and a sweet glaze on them. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
The doughnuts are easy to make, and they require ingredients that most bakers would already have in their pantry or fridge. Unlike the glazed doughnuts, these doughnuts also require sour cream. And this was the one ingredient I didn't already have at home, so I had to take Elayne to Publix before we could start our baking! 
In the picture to the right, the espresso powder is not pictured. I completely forgot to pull it out before taking the picture! ...And I didn't realize it until much later... Oops... 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/06/05/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts11.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. Grease your doughnut pan with nonstick cooking spray.<br>Next, you need to make the crumb topping. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Chop up your cold butter into tiny pieces, and add these butter pieces to your sugar mixture. Stir them into the mixture until the dry ingredients &amp; butter combine into a clumpy mixture. Chill the crumb topping in the freezer while you make the doughnut batter.</p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/06/05/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts10.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/06/05/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts9.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Now we need to make the doughnut batter. Start by whisking together the flour, brown sugar, salt, baking powder, and espresso powder in a large bowl.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/06/05/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts8.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>In a separate bowl, whisk together the sour cream, melted butter, and egg. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingedients, and mix until they‚Äôre just combined. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/06/05/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts7.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/06/05/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts6.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Spoon the batter into the doughnut pan, filling it about halfway full. This batter is thicker than the batter for the Glazed Doughnuts, so I chose to just spoon in the batter. But you could also pipe it if you would prefer. Once the batter is in the pan, top each doughnut with some of the crumb topping from the freezer. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/06/05/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Bake the doughnuts for 10-12 minutes. They are ready when you can insert a toothpick and have it come out clean. Let the doughnuts cool in the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/06/05/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts4.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/06/05/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts/CoffeeCakeDoughnuts3.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>I will admit, I messed up a little when making these. I was distracted by Elayne, trying to keep her happy, while also attempting to keep her out of all the cabinets that I have not gotten around to babyproofing yet! So I completely forgot to add the crumb topping onto my doughnuts before baking them!! ü´¢ I realized my mistake when I pulled them out of the oven. So I quickly added some crumb topping and put them back in the oven for a few more minutes. The crumb topping didn‚Äôt bake as much as it is supposed to, but it still tasted yummy! </p>
<p>Next, make the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla. If the glaze is too thick, you can add a little more milk until you reached your desired consistency. You want the glaze to be decently runny, so that it will cover the doughnut but not glob on top of it.<br>Once the doughnuts are completely cool, drizzle the doughnuts with the glaze. Allow the glaze to set for about 30 minutes before serving. </p>

    <title>Cookies &amp; Cream Cookies</title>

These cookies have Oreos mixed into them; it's like cookie-ception! 
<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>Who doesn‚Äôt love a good Oreo? You get the sweet chocolate with the creamy center. These cookies have all that and more. They are very rich and indulgent, but they are so easy to make! </p>
<p>This recipe uses a cake mix. This means, no measuring of flour or sugar! The only ingredient that really needs to be measured is the vanilla. How can this be? Well, the ingredients are very simple: 1 box of cake mix, 1 stick of butter (no measuring required there), 1 egg, the vanilla which needs measuring, 4 ounces of cream cheese (but cream cheese comes in a brick of 8 ounces, so simply slice it in half), crushed Oreo, white chocolate chips, and chocolate chips. I guess, technically, the Oreos and chocolate chips need to be measured, but I always end up estimating these anyways üòä </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
The recipe is very straight-forward. First, I like to go ahead and get the Oreos crushed. To do this, I like to place the cookies in a cake pan, and then use a jar to crush them. This is my preferred method, but there are several other ways of doing this. You could put the cookies in a large Ziploc bag, and then use a rolling pin to crush them. Or, instead of a rolling pin, use a mallet. You could potentially put them in a food processor, but if you do this, make sure not to over-process them. You still want some medium-sized cookie chunks. 

<div>
    <img src="/2022/04/22/CookiesCreamCookies/Cookies&CreamCookies1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
<div>
    <img src="/2022/04/22/CookiesCreamCookies/Cookies&CreamCookies2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, combine the cake mix, butter, egg, and vanilla in a mixer and beat until a soft dough forms. Then add in the cream cheese and mix again. It‚Äôs best if the cream cheese is softened. This allows it to be mixed in more easily, and you are not left with chunks of cream cheese in your dough. Finally, fold in the crushed Oreos, chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips by hand. So simple! </p>
<p>It is best to let the dough refrigerate for about 30 minutes prior to baking. This will keep the cookies from spreading too much as they are baked. However, if you‚Äôre short on time, chilling is not strictly neccessary. </p>
<p>These cookies only need to bake for 9 minutes, on a greased cookie sheet, and then only need about a minute to cool slightly on the pan before being removed to cool completely.</p>
<div style="display:flex;">
One thing to note is that they will look underdone when they are removed from the oven. But don't worry, they will firm up slightly as they cool.

    <title>Measuring Dry vs Liquid Ingredients</title>
    <url>/2022/05/03/DryVsLiquid/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<img src="/2022/05/03/DryVsLiquid/MeasuringCups.jpg" class="top-image">
<div class="post-body">
There is a difference between dry and liquid measuring cups, and it is important that they are used correctly.

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>So why do we need different measuring cups for dry ingredients and liquids? We‚Äôve all heard that 1 cup equals 8 ounces, so it shouldn‚Äôt matter, right? Not exactly‚Ä¶ </p>
<p>In actuality, 1 liquid cup is equal to 8 liquid ounces. But what about the dry ingredients? We can‚Äôt say that one cup of one ingredient will actually be 8 ounces, or that a cup of two different ingredients will weigh the same. Think about this: one cup of powdered sugar is going to weigh much less than one cup of chocolate chips. This is the root of why we have different measuring cups for liquids vs dry ingredients. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Liquid measuring cups allow you to fill the cup up to a specified line in order to get the exact amount needed. They also typically include a spout to allow you to pour your measured ingredient without spilling. When measuring liquids, it is important to get down to eye level with the line you're filling to, so that you can make sure you have measured correctly. Standing above the measuring cup, looking down will cause you to under-measure. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/05/03/DryVsLiquid/LiquidMeasuringCups.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Dry measuring cups are meant to be filled to overflowing. Then, use a flat edge, like a knife, to scrape off the excess amount. This way, you can fill the cup exactly to make sure you have the right amount.

<p>All of my recipes call for cup or spoon measurements of dry ingredients (i.e. 1 cup, ¬Ω cup, 1 tsp, ¬Ω tsp), instead of ounces. But, what do you do when a recipe calls for a certain number of ounces of a dry ingredient? This is the case where you need to weigh your ingredient using a food scale. </p>

    <title>How to Apply a Crumb Coat of Icing</title>

<div class="post-body">
When frosting a cake, starting with a crumb coat allows for the final cake to look neater and more professional. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>So what exactly is a crumb coat?<br>Have you ever tried to frost a cake, but you keep getting crumbs from the cake in your the icing? It ends up making your cake look messy, and it is so frustrating when you just want your cake to look nice.<br>This is where the crumb coat is your best friend. It may take a little more time than if you went straight into the final layer of icing, but the extra effort will make your cake look so much better. </p>
<p>Here‚Äôs how to do it:<br>Once your cakes have cooled completely and are assembled (layers stacked and icing between the layers), spread a thin layer of icing on the sides and top of the cake. It is important to make sure the cakes are cooled completely. Otherwise, the frosting will begin to melt, and your cake will end up looking messy.<br>If crumbs get into this initial layer of frosting, it is ok. Also, it‚Äôs ok if your cake shows through this layer of frosting. The crumb coat doesn‚Äôt need to be pretty - it will be covered by the final layer of frosting. </p>
<p>Once the crumb coat is applied, put the cake in the fridge for about 30 minutes. This allows the crumb coat frosting to firm up, which will make it easier to apply the final layer of icing. </p>
<p>After the crumb coat frosting has firmed up some, you can finally apply the final layer of frosting and any decorations you want. </p>

Happy Easter!! üòÑ

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Today we had a lot of fun!<br>I know this wasn‚Äôt Elayne‚Äôs first Easter, but it was the first one she could really participate in. And she absolutely loved it! </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Last night, we dyed eggs. Elayne was very curious and loved seeing the eggs come out of the dye a different color. But she didn't have much patience to wait for the eggs to finish coloring. 
<div>

</div>
</div>

<br>

<div style="display:flex;">
When she got up this morning, she saw her Easter basket on the table, and her face lit up. She proceeded to pull out all the goodies from her basket to either play with them or throw them around. Then, she hunted for eggs in the living room. She had lots of fun finding them and then walking them over to her basket. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/09/Easter2023/Easter2023-3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>After the morning festivities, we went to my parents‚Äô house for brunch. And of course she loved seeing her Grandma, Pop, Gigi, and Aunt Lauren. As the baby of the family, she gets <i>all</i> the attention. And she received <i>another</i> Easter basket, and got to hunt for more eggs. So her day was made. üòä</p>

</div>

<p>Of course, since it was a holiday, and since we were meeting up with people, I had to do some baking. üòÑ<br>I made some cute, easy treats that could actually be modified to be made any time of year. I made some <a href="/2023/04/09/EasterSugarCookies/" title="Easter Sugar Cookies">Easter Sugar Cookies</a> and <a href="/2023/04/09/HaystackNests/" title="Haystack Nests">Haystack Nests</a>.</p>

Colorful sugar cookies with a Hershey's Kiss on top... These cookies are perfect for everyone, adults and kids alike. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<div style="display:flex;">
I figured these cookies worked really well for Easter because they are so colorful. But the great thing about these cookies is that you can make them for any occasion. Christmas cookies? Use red and green sprinkles. Halloween cookies? Orange sprinkles. Everyday cookies? Any color sprinkles, or even just plain sugar. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/09/EasterSugarCookies/EasterSugarCookies1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>To make these, I used my typical <a href="/2022/11/14/SugarCookies/" title="Sugar Cookies">Sugar Cookies</a> recipe. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
There are only a couple of differences. Instead of rolling the cookie dough in regular sugar, roll it in colorful sugar sprinkles.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/09/EasterSugarCookies/EasterSugarCookies2.jpg" class="floating-image">

<p>Bake the cookies at 350¬∞F for 15 minutes. After removing from the oven, allow the cookies to cool slightly for just a minute. Then press a Hershey‚Äôs Kiss on each cookie. Allow the cookies to cool completely. </p>

Two years already?? Where has my tiny baby gone?!

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>I can‚Äôt believe my little baby is already an energetic toddler! She is the happiest and smartest little girl. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs amazing to think back and realize how much she has grown up in the past year! By this time last year, Elayne wasn‚Äôt walking yet. And now she runs everywhere! She has also grown into a good little helper. She likes to help me load and unload the dishwasher, run the washing machine, unpack the groceries, and pick out my clothes. And of course, she loves to help me bake! </p>
<p>She isn‚Äôt talking much yet, but she understands everything we say to her. She is very smart - future Georgia Tech girl maybe? I can hope at least üòä She‚Äôs going to outsmart me and Tommy before we know it. She figures out games and puzzles quickly, and she has figured out how to get into my phone and use the massage function on our theater seats in the basement. Too smart already! And she is the best little reader. We read books <i>all the time</i>!!! We have books piled all over our house. But we always allow more books because reading is good üòÑ </p>
<p>We had Elayne‚Äôs birthday party yesterday. She had a lot of fun having her friends over and getting all the attention. Plus all the toys! So many new toys to figure out and carry all over the house! üòÇ </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
The party was a lot of fun, but it was a ton of work. Luckily, I had Tommy, my mom, my mother-in-law, and my best friend there to help! We did all the cooking, decorating, and cleaning. And of course, I had to bake and decorate Elayne's cake! She wanted a Cocomelon themed party. So I made Cocomelon cake! 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/24/ElayneIsTwo/ElayneIsTwo5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>I definitely stressed over the cake! I was so worried that it wouldn‚Äôt turn out well. I‚Äôm a good baker, but I‚Äôm still working on my decorating skills. I can typically make something look nice, but trying to do a specific decoration or pattern doesn‚Äôt always turn out how I want it to. My plan had been to get the cake completely decorated and finished the night before the party. That way, I could take my time with it and I wouldn‚Äôt have to stres as much the morning of the party. Well, that plan didn‚Äôt work out ü§£ As I was frosting the cake, it started to split!!! So I quickly got it all coated with frosting and filled the split with frosting. Then I had to let it sit in the fridge overnight to allow the frosting to harden and hold the cake together. Then I was up at 6am to finish the decorating before I had to prepare for the rest of the party. So stressful, haha! But it did turn out very well. I was very pleased with it! </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/09/24/ElayneIsTwo/ElayneIsTwo8.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>In addition to the cake, I also made brunch food for Elayne‚Äôs party. This included french toast casserole, scrambled eggs, bacon, sausage, cheese grits, chia seed pudding, a cheese board, chicken nuggets (Elayne‚Äôs favorite), and mac &amp; cheese cups. </p>

    <title>Easter Nest Cake</title>

Want a cute cake to make for Easter? This one is not nearly as complicated as it looks! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>For Easter a few years ago, husband and I were going to meet my family for an outdoor picnic. And, me being me, I decided I wanted to bake something for the occasion. </p>
<p>As is usually the case, I didn‚Äôt have the time to do something super complicated. I wanted something quick and easy, but still fun and cute. I will admit, this was a little more time consuming than I initially thought, but it was still easy. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
So how does one go about making a bird nest cake?? Well first, you need a cake. I used a simple box cake mix, and I made 2 round cakes. It honestly doesn't matter what type of cake you make: chocolate, vanilla, strawberry, you name it. I let the cakes bake and cool fully. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/05/07/EasterCake/EasterCake3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Once cooled, I took the first cake and leveled off the top. By this, I mean that I cut a thin sliver of cake off the top, so that it was flat and not rounded. We want the top to be flat so that the cakes can stack well. Spread a layer of chocolate frosting over the top of this cake. For simplicity, I just used store-bought frosting, but you can always make your own, if desired. I used chocolate because I wanted the brown for the nest. But really, any frosting will do fine. </p>
<p>Now, for the most complicated part: We need to cut out a portion of the second cake. I recommend doing this on a separate plate, to prevent crumbs and mess by your finished product. So how do I make the cut out? Take a good knife (I like to use a long paring knife, but any will do), and cut a ring surrounding the center of the cake, making the ring‚Äôs diameter about half the diameter of the cake. Be sure not to cut all the way through the cake. You should only go about half way down. We want to still have a layer of cake remaining underneath. Gently slide the knife into the cut ring and toward the center of the cake, working to separate the middle from the outer ring. Do not remove too much cake - you can always cut out more if necessary. </p>
<p>Once the middle of the cake was removed, I used my knife to smooth out the edges a little, so that I was left with a smooth edge, instead of a sharp one. Now you can move your second cake layer to place on top of the first. Move it gently and carefully, as the middle is now more fragile than the rest of the cake. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Now, it's time for the frosting. Spread a layer of frosting over the entire cake. It does not need to be a thick layer, as you will be adding more to create the nest effect. 
Place the remaining frosting in a pastry bag, fitted with a decorating tip. I chose to use a small round tip, so that the frosting could come out looking like twigs. But you can use a fancier tip is desired. Rotating around the cake, squeeze the frosting in a mostly random pattern. I ended up going around the cake a few times, so that I could put the base layer of "nest", and then add more to create a layered effect, making it look more realistic. It was a little time consuming, but it was not difficult. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/05/07/EasterCake/EasterCake1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Finally, you get to add the finishing touches. I bought some candy eggs from the grocery store. As I was buying them the day before Easter, there weren‚Äôt many options left. I ended up having to buy some shimmery ones, but they worked just fine. And I also found some cute chocolate chicks to accompany the eggs. üòä </p>
<p>All in all, my Easter cake was a success. I was happy with it, and I received compliments from my family, which always makes me feel good. </p>

    <title>Elayne is One!!</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<img src="/2022/09/29/ElayneIsOne/ElayneIsOne.jpg" class="top-image">
<div class="post-body">
It's official - I have a one year old! Elayne turned one last week, and we had her first birthday party this past weekend. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Her party was a lot of fun. We had a bunch of friends over, made a bunch of food, and had a really good time. Elayne did very well. I thought she was going to be over-stimulated or fussy, but she is apparently very good at being the center of attention. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs a little surreal, realizing that it has already been an entire year since Tommy and I came home from the hospital with our beautiful baby girl. </p>
<p>It‚Äôs true what people say - that they grow up too quickly, and that you need to cherish every moment. The past year has flown by. It‚Äôs crazy to look back at the pictures from when Elayne was first born, and to see how much she has changed. When Elayne was a newborn, she was tiny. Just over 7 pounds, with very skinny arms and legs. And now she‚Äôs over 19 pounds, lean and strong. She crawls all over the house, and is constantly pulling up to stand. She‚Äôs going to be walking anytime now! </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2022/09/29/ElayneIsOne/Newborn.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2022/09/29/ElayneIsOne/12months.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>I still can‚Äôt believe how much my life has changed in the past year. I‚Äôm no longer working - instead I‚Äôm staying home to raise Elayne. That was a big adjustment for me. Up until last year, I had a job and was financially independent ever since graduating college. And then all of a sudden I‚Äôm relying on my husband‚Äôs income for all our bills. That definitely took some getting used to. And if I‚Äôm being honest, some days I‚Äôm still not fully used to it. </p>
<p>But I‚Äôm learning to adapt to how my life is constantly changing. Elayne is learning new skills all the time, and she‚Äôs getting smarter everyday. She‚Äôs keeping me on my toes. And it‚Äôs hard. Keeping up high energy all day because she wants to play. Doing everything I can do make her eat solid foods and wean off of formula. Keeping my patience when she tests my nerves. And trying to make sure that every single thing I‚Äôm doing is in her best interest. It is by far the hardest job I‚Äôve ever had. </p>
<p>But I‚Äôm so in love. And I made the right decision. Because even though it‚Äôs hard, I get to be home to see her master all her new skills. And I get to cuddle her, and give her all the attention that she craves. </p>
<p>The past year has been the hardest year of my life, but also the most rewarding. I wouldn‚Äôt change a thing. </p>

Elayne is 14 months old, and she is walking!! üòÄ

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>We knew it would be soon. For a while now, she has been working on standing without holding onto anything. And then she started taking one to two little tiny baby steps before falling down. But she kept trying. </p>
<p>And now she can walk all by herself!! She is still a little wobbly, and so she takes cautious steps. But I‚Äôm sure she‚Äôll be running around the house in no time. </p>
<p>Despite being able to walk by herself, she still loves to hold our hands or use her walker. Or, sometimes she likes to hold our hand <i>and</i> use her walker. That‚Äôs always interesting. When she uses her walker two-handed, she has learned how to turn it herself around corners. But when she is holding onto my hand or Tommy‚Äôs with one of her own, and then also holding onto her walker with the other hand, she can‚Äôt turn around corners. So we are constantly needing to steer it for her. But we are enjoying every minute of it!</p>

These Fluffernutter Cookies are rich with peanut butter, with the added sweetness of marshmallows.

<p>I know, it sounds like these cookies would be overwhelmingly sweet, but trust me, they‚Äôre not. They are a delicious cookie, especially for anyone who loves peanut butter like I do. </p>
<p>I made these cookies for Elayne‚Äôs birthday party on Saturday. They were a big hit! Everyone loved them. My mom even said they were her favorite food of the day (when we had <i>sooo</i> much food)! </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
These cookies are not difficult to make, but you will make a mess doing it. But that's ok! As I tell Elayne all the time "It's ok to make a mess, as long as you clean up afterwards". üòÑ 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/24/FluffernutterCookies/FluffernutterCookies2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating your oven to 350¬∞F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Then, in a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt together. Set this bowl aside until it's time to add it to the dough. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/24/FluffernutterCookies/FluffernutterCookies3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the peanut butter and softened butter. Beat these together until the mixture is creamy. Then, add in ¬Ω c sugar and the brown sugar. Continue to mix until all ingredients are combined well. Finally, add in the egg and vanilla. Mix again until they are fully incorporated. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/24/FluffernutterCookies/FluffernutterCookies6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, gradually add the flour mixture into the dough. Mix between each addition of flour. If you try to add all the flour at once, it will fly everywhere when you turn the mixer on. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/24/FluffernutterCookies/FluffernutterCookies7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Now we need to make the cookies. Scoop the dough out into large spoonfuls. Flatten each spoonful of dough into a disc shape. We do this because we are going to put the marshmallow fluff in the center of each cookie. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/09/24/FluffernutterCookies/FluffernutterCookies1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, time for the messy part. Add a small scoop of marshmallow fluff into the middle of each disc of dough. Roll the discs into a rough ball shape. It will not be perfect, but that‚Äôs alright. We want most of the marshmallow fluff in the center of the ball. Some will poke out, and this is ok. Roll each ball into the remaining ¬º c sugar, and place them on the prepared baking sheet.</p>

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Finally, bake the cookies for 9-10 minutes, until they begin to turn a golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool for a couple minutes on the baking sheet before removing to cool fully.

    <title>Basic Equipment to Have</title>

Every baker needs her tools!

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>While it is not strictly necessary to have every piece of baking equipment, there are some essentials that I truly believe are game-changers for baking. Below I‚Äôve listed some of the basic equipment you will want. But let‚Äôs be real, there are sooo many baking appliances, gadgets, and devices now. There are specialty pans to make specific cakes, or to create different shapes. I already have more baking pans than I need. But occasionally it‚Äôs fun to make those specialty items that are not my normal go-to baked goods. If I want to make a cheesecake, my springform pans are a must. I also have mini springform pans large bundt pans, mini bundt pans, doughnut pans, loaf pans, mini muffin pans, etc. You get the picture. It‚Äôs very easy to accumulate a lot of baking equipment. </p>
<ol class="post-body">
    <div style="display:flex;">
    <li>Stand Mixer
        <ul>
            <li>I personally <b><i>love</i></b> my KitchenAid mixer! To me, having an electric stand mixer is just so crucial for baking. It allows me to prep other ingredients while my mixer runs, and I don't have to stand there holding up a handheld mixer. I also love that it comes with different attachments: the paddle attachment, whisk, and dough hook. There are also other brands of stand mixers, but KithenAid is my favorite. Mine has lasted me for several years, no issue. And my mom has had hers for as long as I can remember without any issues.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <div>
        <img src="/2022/05/02/EquipmentNeeded/Equipment2.jpg" class="floating-image">
    </div>
    </div>
    <li>Measuring cups & spoons</li>
    <li>Liquid measuring cup
        <ul>
            <li>It is important to note that fluid ounces differ from solid ounces. This is why it is always important to measure your wet ingredients using a liquid measuring cup.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Spatulas
        <ul>
            <li>I highly recommend getting some silicone <b><i>heat resistant</b></i> spatulas. I use mine for everything! I love the silicone because they are so versitile. I use them for all of my baking and cooking. Nothing sticks to them, and they also will not scratch my good pans. You definitely want the heat resistant ones though, so that it doesn't melt while you're stirring something on the stove!</li>
            <li>I also like to get the spatulas that are fully silicone, instead of the ones that have a plastic handle and silicone head. I find that the latter tend to break more easily. Also, they don't get as clean, because food inevitably gets stuck in the space between the plastic and silicone.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cookie sheets</li>
    <li>Cake pans</li>
    <li>Cupcake/Muffin pan</li>
    <li>Mixing bowls</li>
    <li>Pastry bags & decorating tips
        <ul>
            <li>These are not strictly necessary, but they are fun to have if you want to make your baked goods look even more presentable. If you don't have pastry bags and tips, you can always use a Ziploc bag with a corner cut off.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>

Who doesn't love a delicious Funfetti cake? Well now you can have it in cookie form.

</a>

<p>I made these cookies for Elayne‚Äôs birthday party. Because what better occasion to make birthday cake cookies than a birthday party??<br><br><br><br><br><br><br><br></p>
<div style="display:flex;">
The cookies tasted delicious - with that distinctly sweet cake batter flavor. The kids, and adults too, all loved them. And since they're made using cake batter, they're very quick and easy to make. You don't need many ingredients, and they don't take much time. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/09/29/FunfettiCookies/FunfettiCookies1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>To make these cookies, start by creaming together butter and sugar using a stand mixer. Add in the eggs and vanilla, and mix until it is all combined. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Next, add in the cake mix and flour. Mix until all ingredients are incorporated. The dough will be very thick. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/09/29/FunfettiCookies/FunfettiCookies2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Finally, scoop the dough into balls and place them onto a greased baking sheet. Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes at 350¬∞F. The cookies will not spread much, so they will still be partially ball-shaped. If you would prefer for them to be more cookie-shaped, I would recommend pressing the balls of dough with the palm of your hand to flatten them slightly before baking.

Ginger, cinnamon, cloves, molasses, and rolled in sugar. The perfect gingerbread cookie. 
<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>My mom‚Äôs Ginger Snap cookies are another holiday staple in my family. This is another recipe that we always bake around Christmas time, and these cookies are always included in the baked goods that we give out to friends and neighbors. </p>
<p>They have all the spices associated with gingerbread, and then they are rolled in sugar before baking, giving them a perfect sweetness. </p>
<p>I have never quite understood why they are called Ginger <em>Snaps</em>, since they do anything but snap. They are a very soft and chewy cookie, which is the best kind. But still, the name stuck. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
These cookies are easy to make. You mix all the dry ingredients into a bowl, and then cut in butter shortening. This can be found in the baking aisle of your local grocery store. It is found near the Crisco and cooking sprays. But "cut in" the shortening, I mean exactly that: cutting. With the shortening in the bowl of dry ingredients, take 2 knives and hold them point down, crossing each other in an X shape. And then proceed to cut the shortening into small pieces. It will seem a little messy at first, and it seems like it will take forever. But the shortening starts to mix with the dry ingredients some, and that seems to make it seem like it's going faster. It doesn't have to be perfect, you just don't want to be left with large clumps of shortening.
<div>
    <img src="/2022/04/17/GingerSnaps/ButterCrisco.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>After cutting in the shortening, you simply mix in some molasses and an egg. Then your dough is ready. Roll the dough into balls, roll them in sugar, and bake them. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
You know they are done baking with the tops of the cookies just begin to crack. If you're not sure, better to go ahead and pull them out. It's always better for cookies to be under done than over.

    <title>How to Grease &amp; Flour Cake Pans</title>
    <url>/2022/07/04/GreaseFlourPans/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<div class="post-body">
When baking cakes, it is important to grease and flour your cake pans. This prevents your cakes from sticking or falling apart. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>But some new bakers may wonder: How exactly does one go about greasing and flouring a cake pan?<br>So here‚Äôs how you do it. </p>
<p>First, you need either some cooking spray or some vegetable oil. I prefer to use cooking spray, simply for convenience. So, spray the bottom and sides of your cake pan generously. Then, I like to take a paper towel and wipe it along the pan. The purpose of this is to make sure the oil gets evenly distributed over the pan without missing any spots. This also prevents having too much oil in the pan. </p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt have cooking spray, or prefer to use vegetable oil, simply pour a little oil on a paper towel and rub it along the bottom and sides of your pan, making sure to cover the entire area. </p>
<p>Next, take a couple pinches of flour and drop them in the pan. Rotate the pan and tap the sides, letting the flour cover and stick to the entire pan. I find it best to do this over the sink, because a little flour typically spills out, especially when trying to coat the sides. If needed to adequately cover the pan, add some more flour, little bits at a time. </p>
<p>Finally, once the entire pan is coated with flour, I like to flip the pan over and tap it on the counter. This helps to get rid of any excess flour or any clumps. </p>
<p>Now you‚Äôre ready to bake some cakes!! </p>

These Guinness Beef Sliders are cheesy and have a deliciously savory flavor. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>I love sliders. Who wouldn‚Äôt love mini sandwiches? Especially when the recipe includes a full bottle of Guinness? </p>
<p>These sliders went over very well with Tommy‚Äôs coworkers. Everyone loved them, even though the ones I made didn‚Äôt look nearly as appetizing as I had hoped they would. This is because I left them in the oven too long, and the tops looked pretty burned. Still tasted great, and they were still a hit. But next time I‚Äôll make sure to take them out of the oven sooner. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
The sliders were easy to make, but they were a little tedious and took some time. 
Start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. 
In a medium pan, melt one tablespoon of butter. Add in the mushrooms, onions, and 3 ounces of Guinness. Heat for 5-7 minutes, until the liquid is mostly absorbed.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/19/GuinnessBeefSliders/GuinnessBeefSliders7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, make the glaze. Combine the remaining 9 ounces of Guinness, butter, brown sugar, onion powder, parsley, and garlic in a medium pan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture is thickened and reduced by about half. Set this aside until ready to use. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/19/GuinnessBeefSliders/GuinnessBeefSliders9.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Slice the rolls in half, and place the bottom half in a 9x13-inch dish. Spread the dijon mustard on the bottom half of rolls. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

</div>

<p>Top the rolls with roast beef and the mushrooms and onions. </p>

</div>

<br>

<div style="display:flex;">
The place the slices of Swiss and cheddar cheese on top of the mushroom/onion mixture. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/19/GuinnessBeefSliders/GuinnessBeefSliders4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Finally, place the top half of the rolls on top of the cheese to complete your sandwich. Pour the set-aside glaze over the sandwiches. You may not use the entire glaze. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/08/19/GuinnessBeefSliders/GuinnessBeefSliders6.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Bake the sliders, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until they are heated through.<br>Make sure to check them periodically to make sure the tops are not starting to burn. They can darken pretty quickly.<br>After they are heated through, remove from the oven and serve warm. </p>

I had never tried making doughnuts before, so this was a great opportunity to try, especially because Elayne loves doughnuts!

<p>These doughnuts are baked, not fried. So they aren‚Äôt as airy or light as Krispy Kreme, but they are still delicious. They are sweet and cake-y, with a yummy glaze on top. </p>
<p>Growing up, my mom never deep fried anything, because she never liked to deal with the mess of frying. And I am the same way. I have no desire to fry foods, so I will stick with baked doughnuts. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
These classic doughnuts are easy to make. And all of the ingredients are items most bakers would find in their pantry or fridge already.

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. Grease your doughnut pan with nonstick cooking spray. Then whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Set this bowl aside.

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, mix the wet ingredients together. In a small bowl, mix together the melted butter, egg, milk, and vanilla. Whisk these until they are fully combined. 
<div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and mix them until just combined. I had a good little helper with my baking today. She wanted to do all the mixing. So naturally, flour ended up all over the counter! üòõ She was also my taste-tester. She had to make sure the sprinkles all tasted good enough for everyone else to eat! üòÑ </p>

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Once the batter is completely mixed, use a pastry bag to pipe the batter into the prepared doughnut pan. This is a very thin batter, and so I found it easiest to pipe it. If you don't have a pastry bag, you can pour the batter into a Ziploc bag, and then cut off one corner and pipe it into the pan that way. Otherwise, you can simply spoon the batter into the pan. But I found spooning this batter to be messier than piping. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/06/05/GlazedDoughnuts/GlazedDoughnuts6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Bake the doughnuts for 10-12 minutes. They are ready when you can insert a toothpick and have it come out clean. Let the doughnuts cool in the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.</p>

    <img src="/2023/06/05/GlazedDoughnuts/GlazedDoughnuts8.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Next, make the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla. If the glaze is too thick, you can add a little more milk until you reached your desired consistency. You want the glaze to be decently runny, so that it will cover the doughnut but not glob on top of it.<br>Once the doughnuts are completely cool, dip the doughnuts into the glaze. Then you can top it with sprinkles if you‚Äôd like. I like adding sprinkles, because they make the doughnuts more fun üòä<br>Allow the glaze to set for about 30 minutes before serving. </p>

    <title>Haystack Nests</title>

These Haystack Nests are the perfect, easy dessert or snack to make. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>I made these for Easter, but you could really enjoy them for any spring-time treat. Or, many people make these in just a ball shape, as opposed to a nest, and then they can be enjoyed year-round. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
They are very quick and easy to make. My only complaint about them is that they can be a little messy to eat, as they tend to melt in your fingers quickly. But some messy fingers never hurt anyone. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/09/HaystackNests/HaystackNests7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by greasing 2 standard-size muffin pans with cooking spray. This will prevent the nests from sticking to the pan, and will allow them to pop out easily. Next, pour the white chocolate chips into a microwavable bowl, and melt the chocolate until it's completely melted and smooth. To do this, I initially heated the chocolate for a minute, then stirred it, and put it back into the microwave for another 30 seconds. By the end of this time, my chocolate was melted. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/09/HaystackNests/HaystackNests6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Then, combine the melted white chocolate, peanut butter, and powdered sugar into a medium-sized bowl. Stir this mixture until all the ingredients are fully combined and the mixture is smooth. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/04/09/HaystackNests/HaystackNests4.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Fold in the chow mein noodles and stir gently until all the noodles are well coated. If you‚Äôve never tried chow mein noodles before, they really don‚Äôt have much taste. They just give a satisfying crunch.<br>When finished folding in the chow mein noodles, spoon the mixture into the greased muffin tins. Use a spoon to gently press down on the center to form a nest shape. Finally, place the egg candies on top of the nest. I used the Cadbury candy eggs, but you can use any egg-shaped candies you‚Äôd like. </p>

    <title>Fudge-Filled Vanilla Bundt Cake</title>
    <url>/2022/11/09/FudgeFilledVanillaBundtCake/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<img src="/2022/11/09/FudgeFilledVanillaBundtCake/FudgeVanillaBundt7.jpg" class="top-image">
<div class="post-body">
I'm 30!! <br>
To celebrate, I had some friends over for a small party. And of course, I made a bunch of food and a cake. Because no birthday is complete without cake. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>For my birthday, I decided to try a fudge-filled vanilla bundt cake. It turned out very well - rich and fudgy, and then topped with a sweet glaze. It was the type of cake that I wouldn‚Äôt make unless having people over, because there is no way I‚Äôd be able to finish it all myself. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
It was a little time consuming, because in addition to making the cake batter, I also had to make the fudge filling and the sugary glaze. But, the good thing about having a glaze is that I didn't have to worry about piping icing, or really decorating at all. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/11/09/FudgeFilledVanillaBundtCake/FudgeVanillaBundt6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>So how do we make a cake like this?<br>First, you need to heavily grease and flour your bundt pan. If your pan is not adequately greased and floured, the cake will stick, and it will not come out of the pan looking pretty. If you don‚Äôt know how to do this, see my post <a href="/2022/07/04/GreaseFlourPans/" title="How to Grease &amp; Flour Cake Pans">How to Grease &amp; Flour Cake Pans</a>.</p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2022/11/09/FudgeFilledVanillaBundtCake/FudgeVanillaBundt10.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>

<p>Now we start with the cake ingredients. Using a stand mixer, cream together butter and sugar until it‚Äôs light and fluffy. Once the butter and sugar are fully creamed together, add in the eggs and vanilla. Mix until all ingredients are combined. Then, add in the baking powder and salt, and mix until combined. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Now, we need to add in the flour and milk. The best way to do this is to add them in small amounts, mixing between each addition. If you dump all the flour into the bowl and turn the mixer on, flour will go everywhere! Once all the flour is added, mix until the batter is smooth. Set the batter aside until it's time to assemble the cake. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/11/09/FudgeFilledVanillaBundtCake/FudgeVanillaBundt5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, start on the fudge filling. Using the stand mixer, beat the cream cheese until it's smooth. Then, melt the chocolate chips, and add them to the cream cheese. Mix until they are combined and smooth. Add in the egg, and beat until the fudge is creamy. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/11/09/FudgeFilledVanillaBundtCake/FudgeVanillaBundt4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Once we have the fudge filling made, we need to assemble the cake.<br>Spread half of the cake batter into the prepared bundt pan. Then, spoon the fudge mixture into the middle of the bundt pan. Make sure the fudge stays in the middle, and does not touch the outsides of the pan. Then, spread the remaining cake batter on top of the fudge. Make sure to fully cover the fudge with the cake batter. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2022/11/09/FudgeFilledVanillaBundtCake/FudgeVanillaBundt3.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2022/11/09/FudgeFilledVanillaBundtCake/FudgeVanillaBundt2.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Bake the cake for 50-55 minutes, until the cake is set. To tell if it‚Äôs set, insert a toothpick into the middle of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is done and ready to be removed from the oven.<br>After removing the cake from the oven, allow it to cool for about 10 minutes before attempting to remove it from the pan. After the cake has been out of the oven for a few minutes, I like to use a plastic fork to pull the cake away from the edges of the pan. This helps to loosen the cake so that it will come out more easily. Invert the pan onto a serving platter or cake stand while the cake is still warm. </p>

These Key Lime Bites are delicious, decadent, and so easy to make!

</a>

<p>This past weekend, my mom and I helped host a baby shower for a friend. I decided to make these as part of the desserts, and they were a big hit! I had doubled the recipe, and almost all of them were gone by the time the shower was over! </p>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>

<div style="display:flex;">
I love key lime pie, and these are the perfect bite-sized take on that. They are incredibly quick and easy to make. I will definitely be making them again in the future. The only downside to these is that the phyllo shells can be a little expensive. So I probably wouldn't plan to make these key lime bites for a huge party. But they were perfect for a baby shower of 25 people.

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. Place the phyllo shells on a baking sheet. I recommend using a baking sheet with edges so that the shells don't slide off.

<p>Wash and zest the lime.<br>In a medium bowl, combine the sweetened condensed milk, sour cream, key lime juice, and 1 teaspoon of lime zest. Stir until the ingredients are well-mixed. </p>

Spoon the lime mixture into the phyllo shells, filling them almost all the way up. Bake for 5 minutes, then remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

These Lemon Blueberry Muffins are a delicious take on a classic recipe. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>I‚Äôve made these muffins a few different times, and each time I‚Äôve received lots of compliments about them. They are very lemon-y without being overwhelming. </p>
<p>They also have a delicious crumb topping, which makes them even more irresistable. If you ask me, any muffin that has a crumb topping is automatically better than those without. And this crumb topping contains oatmeal, which gives it a uniquely satisfying cruch. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
These muffins are also easy to make. More steps than you'll see in some cookies, but nothing actually difficult. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/28/LemonBlueberryMuffins/LemonBlueberryMuffins7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. Line some muffin pans with muffin liners. Then proceed to make the crumb topping. In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, sugar, flour, oats, and salt. Mix it with a fork until it is combined and crumbly. Set the topping aside for later.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/28/LemonBlueberryMuffins/LemonBlueberryMuffins8.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, in the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the softened butter until it's fluffy. Add in the sugar. Continue mixing until the butter and sugar are well-combined. Then add the eggs, mixing until just incorporated. Finally, add the buttermilk, vanilla, and lemon zest, mixing until well-combined.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/07/28/LemonBlueberryMuffins/LemonBlueberryMuffins10.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>In a separate medium bowl, combine together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/07/28/LemonBlueberryMuffins/LemonBlueberryMuffins11.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/07/28/LemonBlueberryMuffins/LemonBlueberryMuffins3.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Divide the batter evenly into the prepared muffin pans. I like to only fill each muffin ‚Öî - ¬æ full. That way, the muffins do not expand too much over the top. Sprinkle the prepared crumb topping onto the top of each muffins. Bake the muffins for 22-25 minutes, until you can insert a toothpick into the middle of a muffin and have it come out clean. Allow the muffins to cool for a few minutes before removing them from the pan to cool completely.</p>

    <img src="/2023/07/28/LemonBlueberryMuffins/LemonBlueberryMuffins5.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Finally, make the glaze by mixing together the lemon juice and powdered sugar until the mixture is smooth. Drizzle the glaze onto the cooled muffins. The glaze adds a nice lemon-y, sweet touch to an already delicious muffin. </p>

    <title>Leprechaun Hat Cakes</title>

    <content><![CDATA[<img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes12.jpg" class="top-image">
<div class="post-body">
These Leprechaun Hat Cakes are a cute, delicious treat for someone wanting to really express your creativity and work on your decorating skills.

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>The concept was easy: make some rainbow cakes, place them on top of a cookie, and decorate.<br>However, these cakes did not prove quite this simple to actually pull off. They did not end up as pretty as I had hoped. And let‚Äôs be real, I‚Äôm not the best at cake decorating and making icing smooth, so I don‚Äôt know why I thought this would be all that simple. However, I still think they turned out pretty cute, and of course, they are delicious. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
So, how do we start? 
First, you need to make your cake batter. Because I don't have as much free time as I once did, I used a cake mix. But if you are feeling like doing some extra baking, feel free to make your own cake from scratch. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Either way, make the batter as the box or recipe indicates. Then, divide your batter into 6 bowls, and add food coloring to make them red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and purple. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes2.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes3.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Next you need to grease your pan. I used a popover pan so that I could get the cylindrical shape for the top of the hat. Layer your rainbow of colored batters. I will say, they cakes rose quite a bit, and I ended up having to slice off the rounded top, so you probably don‚Äôt want to fill the pan quite as much as I did. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes10.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes4.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Bake the cakes at 350¬∞F for about 20 minutes, or until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Remove the cakes from the oven and allow them to cool for a few minutes before removing them from the pan. Once out of the pan, allow the cakes to cool completely on a wire rack. This is important because if you try to frost a warm cake, the frosting will melt and make a huge mess. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes5.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes6.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
While the cakes cool, you can prep the frosting. For the sake of time, I used store-bought frosting, but you're always welcome to make your own. You'll need mostly green frosting, with a little black frosting as well. Spoon your frosting into bowls, add food coloring to them, and mix well. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes11.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Once the cakes are fully cooled, you can begin decorating. Slice off the rounded portion of the cake, so that you are left with only the cylindrical portion. Spread a little frosting on top of a cookie, and place the cake on top. I recommend placing all the cakes on all the cookies, and then placing them in the fridge for about 30 minutes, so that the frosting has a chance to harden. This will keep the cake from sliding off the cookie as you try to spread icing over the rest of it. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LeprechaunHatCakes/LeprechaunHatCakes8.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>After the cakes have chilled, you can begin spreading green frosting over the entire cake and cookie. This part proved much more difficult than I had originally anticipated. I made a huge mess. Frosting and food coloring all over my hands. Frosting on the countertops. Frosting on my shirt. I guess if you‚Äôre not making a mess, you‚Äôre not baking well enough üòÇ I will say, I did find it best to first make sure to cover the entire cake because worrying about smoothing the frosting. When I focused on covering before smoothing, my cakes turned out much neater. After the green frosting is spread, I recommend placing the cakes in the fridge again for another 20-30 minutes. This just makes the cakes a little easier to handle as you pipe on the black frosting. So after the cakes have chilled, spoon the black frosting into a pastry bag. Pipe some black frosting around the base of the cake, and then add a square of black frosting to serve as the buckle on the hat.</p>

<p>Whether you‚Äôre sitting out at a St. Patrick‚Äôs Day parade, going to a party, or simply hanging around the house with your kids, these Lucky Charms bars will be a hit. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
They are simply Rice Krispy treats, but made with Lucky Charms. How much easier could it get? Plus, they only take about 5 minutes to make. And I know that having a stash of quick and easy recipes is always a must, especially when you have kids running around.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LuckyCharmsBars/LuckyCharmsBars1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
So, we proceed just like when making Rice Krispy treats. Grease a 9"x13" pan. In a pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Then add the marshmallows and vanilla. Continue to stir until the marshmallows are completely melted.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/03/17/LuckyCharmsBars/LuckyCharmsBars2.jpg" class="floating-image">

</div>

<p>Then add the Lucky Charms to the marshmallow mixture. Stir until the cereal is fully coated. Pour the cereal mixture into the prepared 9‚Äùx13‚Äù pan, and press to form to the edges. </p>

Merry Christmas!! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>We had a relaxing, and also a somewhat atypical Christmas this year.<br>On Christmas Eve, we had some friends over for brunch. Well, about 30 minutes before they arrived here that morning, our heat went out on our main floor and basement levels. Luckily, the upstairs remained alright. So Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and for about 3 days after Christmas, we were running space heaters in our living room, with plastic sheeting covering the doorways to keep the heat in. And we walked around all bundled up. It wasn‚Äôt ideal, but we were lucky that the upstairs heat was still working, so we were comfortable while sleeping at night. </p>
<p>On Christmas Day, we started the day doing our Christmas traditions just the 3 of us. First, we had to get our pictures on the stairs. When I was growing up, my parents made me and my sisters sit at the top of the stairs and take a picture there before we were allowed to go downstairs and see what Santa brought. My sisters and I used to complain about this, claiming it was silly. But now, looking back at all the pictures, I have such good memories of me and my sisters sitting on those stairs, anxiously waiting to go downstairs and open presents. We used to sit up there laughing, waiting for our parents to take the picture and let us downstairs. So now I want to continue this tradition with my own family. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2022/12/25/MerryChristmas2022/Christmas2022-6.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Then, after pictures on the stairs, we let Elayne open her presents at our house. 
And after that, we went to my parents' house to celebrate with the rest of the family. We had a lot of fun eating brunch, opening presents, and just spending time together. 
<div>
    
</div>
</div>

<p>Elayne had so many presents to open! I think she got a little overwhelmed, but she definitely enjoyed herself! The biggest hit was her own rocking chair. She immediately crawled up into it and started rocking. It was very cute. And she looked so proud of herself for getting it to rock back and forth. </p>

This Honey Oat Bread has just the right amount of sweetness to make it delicous.

<p>Up until yesterday, I had never made my own homemade bread before. But how could I be a baker and never even attempt to make bread?? So I figured I should try it. It turned out much better than I expected! I think I will try more breads in the future. </p>
<p>My only issue with making bread is the amount of time it takes. You make the dough, but then you have to let it rise, which takes a while. And only after it has fully risen can you bake it. So if you‚Äôre planning to make your own bread, make sure you have plenty of time for it. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
That being said, the dough was very easy to make, and the baking time wasn't too bad. And the bread tasted great, so it was well worth the extra time. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/18/HoneyOatBread/HoneyOatBread10.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by combining all the dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer. This includes the flour, ¬æ cup of old-fashioned oats, yeast, and salt. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/18/HoneyOatBread/HoneyOatBread9.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Then, in a small pan, heat the milk and butter until the butter is just melted. Stir in the warm water and ¬º cup of honey. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/18/HoneyOatBread/HoneyOatBread8.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Add the milk/butter mixture to the flour mixture. Using the dough hook attachment for the stand mixer, mix the dough for 6-8 minutes. Be sure to check the dough every so often to make sure the dough is not becoming over-kneaded. If the dough is over-kneaded, it will start to feel tough and difficult to stretch.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/18/HoneyOatBread/HoneyOatBread7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Once the dough is kneaded, you need to let it rise. Lightly oil a medium-sized bowl. Place the dough into the oiled bowl, and cover it with a clean, dry kitchen towel. Allow it to sit for about an hour so that it can double in size. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/04/18/HoneyOatBread/HoneyOatBread6.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/04/18/HoneyOatBread/HoneyOatBread5.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
After you've let the dough rise in the bowl, roll the dough out into a loaf shape. Lightly oil your loaf pan, and place the dough into the pan. Again, let the dough sit for another hour to let it rise further. Once it is finished rising, brush the dough with the remaining 2 tablespoons of honey. Then top the dough with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oats.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/04/18/HoneyOatBread/HoneyOatBread4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Bake the bread at 350¬∞F for 40 minutes. After 30 minutes, I rotated my pan so that the bread would bake evenly. Once it is finished baking and the bread is golden brown in color, remove it from the oven. Allow the bread to cool fully before removing it from the loaf pan. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/04/18/HoneyOatBread/HoneyOatBread3.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/04/18/HoneyOatBread/HoneyOatBread2.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Once cooled, you can slice and enjoy. I loved how the crust had a slightly sweet taste from the honey. But the middle of the bread is not very sweet. This allows the bread to be perfect for many uses. It would be great for sandwiches or french toast. Or, if you have a major sweet tooth like me, top it with some Nutella ü§§</p>

    <title>Nutella Peanut Butter Cookies</title>

Peanut butter cookies are a classic, but adding Nutella can only make them better!

</a>

<p>If I‚Äôm being perfectly honest, peanut butter cookies were never my favorite. I mean, don‚Äôt get me wrong, if they‚Äôre in front of me, I‚Äôll eat them and even enjoy them. But they were never my go-to choice for a cookie to make. But adding Nutella to peanut butter cookies can only make them better! </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
These cookies are very easy to make. Start by preheating your oven to 350¬∞F, and grease a baking sheet. 
With an electric mixer, cream together the softened butter, sugar, and brown sugar until they are light and fluffy. Then add in the vanilla, eggs, and peanut butter. Mix again until it's all fully combined.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/03/08/NutellaPBCookies/NutellaPBCookies6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<br>
<div style="display:flex;">
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing between each addition. Finally, once all the flour mixture is in, add the Nutella and mix until just incorporated. Try not to overmix this. The cookie dough will be very thick, but that's ok. 
<div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Scoop the dough into 1-inch balls on your greased baking sheet. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/03/08/NutellaPBCookies/NutellaPBCookies4.jpg" class="floating-image">

<p>Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes. They will look underdone, but will firm up some as they cool. Allow the cookies to cool for a couple minutes before removing them from the pan to cool completely. </p>

    <title>Nutella Shortbread Bars</title>
    <url>/2022/06/02/NutellaShortbreadBars/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<img src="/2022/06/02/NutellaShortbreadBars/NutellaShortbreadBar3.jpg" class="top-image">
<div class="post-body">
Any dessert the contains Nutella could only be delicious! Nutella is one of those foods that goes with just about anything... <br>
Graham crackers: yes <br>
Strawberries: definitely <br>
Waffles: of course <br>
Toast: yes please <br>

<p>So why not shortbread? </p>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>
I love these shortbread bars because they are not overly sweet. The shortbread has a saltiness to it that balances out the Nutella really well. And the creaminess of the Nutella pairs well with the crumbly texture of the shortbread. 

<p>I remember the first time I ever tried Nutella. My parents had gone to Germany, and they first had it during their trip. They thought they had discovered the best thing in the world. They came home with a case full of the stuff. My sisters and I tried it and loved it too. And then a few days later, we discovered we could buy it in the grocery store‚Ä¶ </p>
<p>I recently made these bars because we were having a couple friends over to watch the Atlanta United game. And it turns out one of them had never had Nutella before!! She has now been turned to the dark side üòä </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
The bars are actually very easy to make. Ingredient-wise, they contain items that most bakers will already have in the pantry, with the exception of Nutella. 
Needed items include: butter, brown sugar, sugar, vanilla, salt, flour, Nutella, and powedered sugar 
I use the term "Nutella", because that's the brand everyone knows. But really, you can use any brand of chocolate hazelnut spread. I used the Publix brand because it was a little cheaper, and I honestly can't tell a difference in the taste between legitimate Nutella or the off-brand. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/06/02/NutellaShortbreadBars/NutellaShortbreadBar7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Here‚Äôs what you need to do:<br>In a large mixer bowl, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and sugar. It is best to do this with a stand mixer, but a handheld electric mixer will work too. It‚Äôll just work your arms more when the dough gets thicker later. Next, add in the vanilla and salt, and mix again until everything is mixed together well. </p>
<p>Finally, we need to add the flour. I highly recommend adding the flour slowly, and mixing between each addition. If you add all the flour at once and turn the mixer on, you will have flour flying out everywhere - trust me, I‚Äôve done it. It‚Äôs not a fun mess to clean up. And then you have to try to estimate how much flour actually stayed in the bowl to determine how much more to add again. Not worth the effort. So, for the flour, measure out the amount needed and put it in a separate bowl. Then, I like to use a ¬º cup and add in a scoop at a time, mixing after each addition, until I have added it all. This vastly cuts down on the mess. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Once all the flour is added, the dough will be thick and a little crumbly. Next, divide the dough in half. We will use one half to create the bottom of the bars, and the remaining half will be saved for later to create the crumble topping. Press one half of the dough into the bottom of a greased 9x13" pan. Place the remaining half in the fridge for later. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/06/02/NutellaShortbreadBars/NutellaShortbreadBar6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Bake the bars at 325¬∞F for about 20 minutes, or until the edges are just starting to turn golden brown. Take the pan out of the oven. Next, it‚Äôs time to spread the Nutella. You need about 20 ounces of Nutella. It doesn‚Äôt have to be exact. The Publix brand chocolate hazelnut spread comes in a 13 ounce jar, and I used a jar and a half. You can add more or less, depending on your preferences. Spread your desired amount of Nutella onto the partially-baked bars. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Next, we need the remaining dough from the fridge. We want to crumble the rest of the dough on top of the Nutella layer. To do this, I grabbed a chunk of dough, and just pinched off pieces and spaced them around on top of the Nutella. Try to get as much coverage of the Nutella as possible, because the shortbread does not spread much when it's baked. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/06/02/NutellaShortbreadBars/NutellaShortbreadBar2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>The fully assembled bars need to bake for another 30 minutes, or until the crumble topping turns a golden brown color. Let the shortbread cool completely. Finally, just before cutting into bars, lightly sprinkle some powdered sugar on top. </p>

</a>

<p>Tommy‚Äôs work had a potluck lunch at their office the other day. Tommy signed up to bring a dessert, meaning I had an excuse to do some baking. And baking for people other than yourself is always more fun. Just knowing that other people will be enjoying your baked goods makes it that much more exciting. </p>
<p>The cake itself was decent, not actually all that much flavor. But the icing‚Ä¶ that was the best part! I mean, isn‚Äôt icing always the best part? But this one was the best icing I think I‚Äôve ever made. It contains espresso powder, giving it a rich coffee taste. I am a person who loves her coffee, and this is no exception. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
It did take a little longer than I expected to make this cake, but it seems that baking always takes just a little longer than initially thought. Maybe I just get so lost in it that I lose track of time. 
But it's not actually hard to make. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/12/06/OreoCake/OreoCake1.jpg" class="floating-image">

<p>This recipe makes two 9-inch cakes. It is necessary to grease and flour the pans, so that the cakes will come out without sticking. If you are unfamiliar with how to grease and flour pans, refer to my post <a href="/2022/07/04/GreaseFlourPans/" title="How to Grease &amp; Flour Cake Pans">How to Grease &amp; Flour Cake Pans</a>.</p>
<p>Remove the cream from the Oreo cookies, and place the cookies into a ziploc bag. Use a rolling pin to crush the Oreos into small pieces. </p>

<p>In a large mixing bowl of a stand mixer, with a whisk attachment, beat the softened butter and oil until well combined. Slowly add the sugar, beating on high until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add in the eggs and vanilla. Beat on high until fully incorporated. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
In a separate bowl, sift together the cake flour, salt, & baking powder. Alternate mixing in the flour mixture and the buttermilk to the butter mixture. Add in the Oreo pieces and mix well.

<p>Split the cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake at 325¬∞F for 40-45 minutes, until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool before removing from pans and transferring to a wire rack.</p>

<div style="display:flex;">
While the cakes are baking, you can begin making the frosting. I like to use a hand mixer for the frosting, but you can also use a stand mixer. So using the mixer of your choice, cream together the softened butter, powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, & salt. Beat the ingredients until light and fluffy. Add the espresso powder. Using all 4 tablespoons of espresso powder will make the icing have a strong coffee flavor, which is how I like it. But if you want less of a coffee flavor, you can use less. I would recommend starting with half the amount and then adding more if desired. Finally, add the Oreo pieces and mix by hand under fully combined.

</div>

<br>
<div style="display:flex;">
Once the cake is fully cooled, you can assemble and frost it. Place the first layer on your cake stand or platter. Spread a generout amount of icing on top, and add the second layer on the top. Spread icing on the very top and sides of the cake, making sure there is plenty on there. Finally, top the cake with both crushed and full Oreos for garnish.

You can't have a baby shower without some adorable baby treats! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Over the weekend, my mom and I helped to host a baby shower for a friend. While we had already agreed to make some strawberry cupcakes (mom-to-be‚Äôs favorite) and a couple other desserts, I figured we needed some of the cute factor. So I made these Nutter Butter Babies. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
They were actually very easy to make, not nearly as time-consuming as I initially thought they would be. And you don't need many ingredients either. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/10/12/NutterButterBabies/NutterButterBabies1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
So how do we make them? Start by melting the white chocolate bark. You can typically find this in the baking section of your grocery store. I highly recommend melting the chocolate in a double boiler. It melts the chocolate evenly and decreases the chances of the chocolate burning. It also helps to keep the chocolate hot while you're dipping the cookies, so that you don't have your chocolate starting to firm up while you're still dipping. Once the chocolate is melted, add in the food coloring. I used blue because my friend is having a boy. But obviously, you can use pink for a girl. Or, if you want to go gender neutral, you could do green or yellow. Or really, any color for that matter. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/10/12/NutterButterBabies/NutterButterBabies7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, lay out some wax paper. This is where you will place the cookies after they're covered with chocolate. The wax paper prevents the chocolate from sticking to it. Dip the Nutter Butters in the chocolate so that they are over halfway covered. Try to scrape off some of the excess chocolate without making the chocolate look messy. Honestly, this was the most difficult part. It really just takes some practice. And find the method that works best for you. You could scrape off some of the excess against the side of the pan. Or you could use a spoon to scrape off some of the chocolate. For some cookies, you may go back and forth scraping then re-dipping, then scraping more. No shame in this - I did it many times. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/10/12/NutterButterBabies/NutterButterBabies6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Allow the chocolate to harden before proceeding to adding the eyes and mouth. Trust me, if your white chocolate is still wet, it is very easy to make a mess when adding the details. I recommend waiting. But don‚Äôt worry, it doesn‚Äôt take very long for the chocolate to harden. </p>
<p>In a small bowl, melt some chocolate chips in the microwave. I just heated it for 30 seconds at a time, stirring between each heating, until the chocolate was fully melted and smooth. You don‚Äôt want to heat it too much at once, or you risk the chocolate burning. Then I transferred the melted chocolate chips to a small squeeze bottle. This allowed me to have more control while decorating. However, if you don‚Äôt have a squeeze bottle, you could use a small piping tip, or you could even dip a toothpick in the chocolate and carefully draw the details onto the cookies. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/10/12/NutterButterBabies/NutterButterBabies5.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/10/12/NutterButterBabies/NutterButterBabies4.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>
<br>

<p>However you choose to do it, draw on the details. I drew the eyes to look like they‚Äôre closed, and a small smile. Also, on some I drew a little curl of hair. I didn‚Äôt do it on all of them, because it was dependent on the amount of space I had left above the eyes of each cookie. Also, I was worried that it would look like too much if I added it to every cookie. Anyways, the curl of hair is optional. If you‚Äôre making little girls, you could do a little hairbow or something. Be creative. </p>

I love Christmas baking!

</a>

<p>My mom and I bake together every year. This year, my older sister was in town, and she joined us in our Christmas baking. </p>
<br>
<br>
<div style="display:flex;">
In year's past, we have baked all day long, completely losing track of time throughout the day. This year was a little different because while we were baking, we were also keeping an eye on Elayne while she played with her toys. So we weren't able to be quite as productive as our typical Christmas baking. But that's ok. We like to make some treats to give to neighbors and close friends, but there is nothing specific that we need to bake. Elayne even joined in on the baking spirit with her holiday baking outfit üòä
<div>
    <img src="/2022/12/22/MeltingSnowmenCookies/ElayneHolidayBaking.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>I always love finding a cute Christmas treat to make. This year, I chose to make Melting Snowmen Cookies. They turned out so adorable! They were a little tedious to make, like many of these type of treats are. But that‚Äôs ok. This is the type of treat that you limit the amount you make. Trying to make too many batches of these would take a long time, because you have to decorate them in addition to baking. But they are fun to make! </p>
<p>So how do we make these cute melting snowmen?<br>Here‚Äôs what you will need: </p>
<ul class="post-body">
    <li>Sugar cookies
        <ul><li>You can use premade cookies or make your own. I used my <a href="/2022/11/14/SugarCookies/" title="Sugar Cookies">Sugar Cookies</a> recipe.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Big marshmallows</li>
    <li>Cookie icing
        <ul><li>I included a recipe below. Or you can use another recipe of your choice.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Food coloring pens</li>
</ul>

<div style="display:flex;">
First, use the food coloring pens to draw a snowman's face on each marshmallow. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/12/22/MeltingSnowmenCookies/MeltingSnowmenCookies2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, make your cookie icing using the recipe below or another recipe of your choice. Spread the icing on top of the sugar cookies. Place a marshmallow on top of each cookie. Allow the icing to set so that it is firm to the touch. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/12/22/MeltingSnowmenCookies/MeltingSnowmenCookies3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Once the icing is set, use the food coloring pens to draw the arms and buttons on the snowmen. I also included a colorful bowtie on each. When drawing on the icing, you may need to only press very very lightly. I think I put slightly too much icing on top of the cookies. And so the icing did not harden all the way through. So if I put too much pressure on the icing with the pen, then it pushed through to the soft icing underneath. So I would recommend only using very light pressure. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/12/22/MeltingSnowmenCookies/MeltingSnowmenCookies4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Once you let the food coloring dry for a couple minutes, you‚Äôre done! You now have some adorable melted snowman cookies!<br><br></p>

To me, nothing screams Christmas-time like peppermint.

<p>These Peppermint Meringue Cookies are very peppermint-y! They are light and airy, and have a nice crisp, minty flavor. They are a fun and festive cookie for your holiday baking. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
I had never made meringue before today. These cookies turned out pretty well, even without having made them before this. And, a great thing about this recipe is that you don't need many ingredients in order to make them. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/12/22/PeppermintMeringueCookies/PeppermintMeringueCookies7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
You start by preheating your oven to 200¬∞F and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper. Then, in a large bowl of a stand mixer, using a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, peppermint extract, and salt on medium speed until soft peaks form. This takes about 6-7 minutes. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/12/22/PeppermintMeringueCookies/PeppermintMeringueCookies5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Then, gradually add the sugar into the egg white mixture, beating on high speed between each addition. After all the sugar is added, beat on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 6-8 minutes. You need to allow the meringue to beat for a while, so that enough air can be incorporated into the mixture. This is why meringue has a light and airy texture. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/12/22/PeppermintMeringueCookies/PeppermintMeringueCookies4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Now, you need to prepare the pastry bag so that the cookies can be piped onto the baking sheet. In order to get the swirled red and white coloring, we need to add red food coloring to the inside of the pastry bag. What I recommend doing is placing the pastry bag in a large cup, with the top of the pastry bag folded over the top of the cup. This helps to hold the pastry bag in place. This is a trick I like to use any I use pastry bags, whether it be for frosting, meringue, or anything else. It is much easier to spoon your filling into the bag if the bag is held open by the cup. 
So, with your pastry bag in your cup, use a small paintbrush or small knife to paint red food coloring stripes up the sides of the pastry bag.
<div>
    <img src="/2022/12/22/PeppermintMeringueCookies/PeppermintMeringueCookies6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Now, spoon the meringue into the prepared pastry bag. Pipe the meringue onto the baking sheet, making the cookies about 1 inch in diameter. Bake the meringue for 90 minutes, or until the meringue appears dry and firm when pressed lightly. </p>

They are light and crisp. The acidity from the lime cuts some of the sweetness. So even though these bars contain white chocolate, they don't taste quite as sweet as your standard rice krispie treat. 
And of course, they are still just as easy to make as normal rice krispie treats.

Start by greasing a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray. Make sure it is well-coated so that the marshmallows don't stick. Set the prepared pan aside until later. In a medium pan over low heat, melt the butter until it's fully melted. Then add in the marshmallows, lime zest, and lime juice. Stir almost continuously until the marshmallows are fully melted and all ingredients are combined. Remove the pan from the heat.

<p>Stir in the Rice Krispies cereal and crushed graham crackers until fully coated. Then stir in the white chocolate chips until well-combined. Press the mixture into the prepared 9x13-inch pan until it‚Äôs in an even layer and covering the entire bottom of the pan. I recommend spraying a little cooking spray on your hands first. This helps prevent the marshmallows from sticking to your fingers. Allow the treats to cool fully before cutting and serving them. </p>

Pizza is the ultimate party food, and these Pizza Bites are always a hit! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<div style="display:flex;">
I made these for our game night over the weekend, and by the end, there were none left. I consider pizza a comfort food. And having them in bite-sized pieces is even better. Yes, I realize that you can just buy pizza rolls in the frozen section of your grocery store. But I really like this recipe because they are less greasy than the frozen pizza rolls. And they are very easy to make. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/20/PizzaBites/PizzaBites7.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
You start by rolling out the pizza dough. I like to use the canned refrigerated pizza dough. It is very easy to roll out, and it's already rectangular, so it's easy to cut into squares. You'll need 2 cans. Can each can into 24 squares. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/20/PizzaBites/PizzaBites2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Chop the block of cheese into 48 cubes. And then roughly chop the pepperoni into small pieces. I usually cut the circles of pepperoni into fourths. Place a cube of cheese and a few pepperoni pieces onto each square of pizza dough. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/20/PizzaBites/PizzaBites1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Then seal up each pizza dough square. Make sure it is sealed well so that cheese does not spill out when it is baked. Then place the pizza bite in a greased baking dish. I find it best to place the side with the sealed seam down. This helps to keep the filling from spilling out. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/20/PizzaBites/PizzaBites3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Next, mix together the olive oil and Italian seasoning. If you don‚Äôt have Italian seasoning, you can use a combination of oregano, basil, parsley, and garlic powder. Then, brush the mixture over the pizza bites. Sprinkle parmesan cheese over all the bites. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/02/20/PizzaBites/PizzaBites5.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Bake the pizza bites for 16-20 minutes at 400¬∞F. They are done when they are a golden brown color. Remove them from the oven, and serve them with pizza sauce for dipping.

<p>Back in high school, I used to make the famous <a href="/2022/03/31/PretzelTreats/" title="Pretzel Treats">Pretzel Treats</a>. Everyone loved them so much. So one day a few years ago, I decided to try them in cookie form. I have to say, they were a success üòä</p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating your oven to 375¬∞F. Grease a baking sheet. 
Then cream together the softened butter and butter shortening. Then add in the sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla. Mix until smooth. Add in the two eggs, and mix again until fully combined. 
<div>

<div style="display:flex;">
In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add the flour mixture into the dough, mixing between each addition.

<p>Roughly chop the Hershey‚Äôs Hugs, and break the pretzels into pieces. I used pretzel sticks, because I already had some at home. But you could use the twist pretzels or the square pretzels as well. Fold in the Hugs, pretzels, and M&amp;M‚Äôs by hand. </p>

These Prosciutto Apple Cheddar Wraps are incredibly easy, and they are a more unique appetizer than your typical chips and dip. 

<br>

</a>

<p>This was my first time making these, and I honestly wasn‚Äôt sure if they would go over well or not. While I was wrapping the apples in prosciutto, I was thinking that the appetizers were much bigger and bulkier than I was originally planning. I was worried people wouldn‚Äôt like that. But it turns out, they were very popular. </p>
<p>Another positive about this recipe is that you can make them ahead of time, and then just pull them out of the fridge when it‚Äôs time for your party to start. Having recipes that can be made ahead of time is so helpful when you‚Äôre making lots of food for a party and everything needs to be ready all at the same time. </p>
<p>Make sure to wash, core, and slice your apples. I sliced each apple into 16 slices, so that they aren‚Äôt too thick. </p>
<p>Slice the white cheddar. I didn‚Äôt make my slices too thick. I tend to like cheese that is pretty thin, but thick enough to not fall apart when picked up. Place a slice of cheddar on top of an apple slice. </p>
<p>Now, wrap the apple and cheddar with prosciutto. I chose to cut the prosciutto in half, so that I had long thin slices. </p>
<p>Once all wraps are made, either serve immediately or place in the fridge until ready to serve. </p>

Full of peanut butter, peanut butter chips, Reese's Pieces, and oats, these cookies are full of flavor and an excellent choice for any peanut butter lover like myself.

<p>Despite my love of peanut butter, I have never been a big fan on the traditional peanut butter cookie. I‚Äôm not entirely sure why. But when I eat them, I always crave something more, an additional texture or flavor. </p>
<p>But these Peanut Butter Monster Cookies have everything I want. The Reese‚Äôs Pieces and peanut butter chips add a creaminess, and the oats help to make the cookies satisfying and more filling. </p>
<p>They are full of a rich peanut butter flavor, are very easy to make, and loved by all who eat them (assuming they like peanut butter üòã). </p>
<p>The cookies are easy to make.<br>In a large bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and peanut butter until it is light and fluffy. Then, mix in the eggs and vanilla until well combined. </p>
<p>Finally, stir in the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, and oats. Stir until everything is combined. Stir in the peanut butter chips and Reese‚Äôs Pieces. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
Roll the dough into balls and place them on a greased baking sheet. Gently press down on the dough to form a thick cookie shape. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges of the cookie are just set. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool for a couple minutes before removing from the pan.

Just three simple ingredients: pretzels, Hershey's Hugs, and M&M's. These treats have the perfect combination of salty and sweet, and they are always a big hit.

</a>

<p>I used to make these delicious treats in high school, and I was always getting requests for more. They are very easy to make, if not a little time consuming. Honestly, the worst part about making them is unwrapping all of the Hershey‚Äôs Hugs. I find the most enjoyable way to do this is to plop down in front of the TV and unwrap them all ahead of time while watching one of my favorite shows. It definitely helps to kill the monotony. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
To make Pretzel Treats, there are only a few simple steps. 
First, line a baking sheet with square pretzels. Using square pretzels is important, because this shape allows the least amount of chocolate to flow through the pretzel, resulting in fewer chocolatey messes and fewer pretzels stuck to the pan. I can usually find the square pretzels in the Snyders of Hanover brand, but any brand will work. 
<div>

</div>
</div>

<p>Next, we need to unwrap the Hershey‚Äôs Hugs and place them on the center of the pretzel. Keeping the Hug as close to the center as possible will prevent the pretzels from sticking together as much. </p>
<p>Then bake the pretzels for about 5 minutes at 150¬∞F, or until the center of the Hug is soft. To test this, I take an M&amp;M and press it into one of the Hugs in the middle of the pan. It if presses in easily, they are ready to come out of the oven. With Hugs, the white chocolate melts more quickly than the milk chocolate inside. So when you press the M&amp;M in, it the outside may be very soft, but the inside is still too firm. This is why it‚Äôs important to check before pulling the pan out of the oven. </p>
<p>Immediately after taking the pan out of the oven, press an M&amp;M into each Hug. This needs to be done before the chocolate cools too much. Then allow the chocolate to cool and harden. You can do this by allowing it to cool at room temperature, or by placing the baking pan in the refrigerator.<br><br></p>

    <title>Pumpkin Pretzels</title>

<div class="post-body">
These Pumpkin Pretzels are an easy, delicious treat for your next Halloween event. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>And yes, I realize we are nowhere near Halloween at the moment. But I have made these treats several times in the past, and I wanted to add some more holiday baking ideas üòä</p>
<p>Pumpkin Pretzels are very simple to make. But they can be a little tedious and time-consuming, because you have to dip each pretzel individually into the white chocolate. However, pretzels in chocolate is always a big hit, and they are the perfect sweet snack!</p>
<br>
<br>
You'll need to make sure you have all the ingredients. You will need: 
<ul>
    <li>Pretzels (the twist kind)</li>
    <li>White chocolate bark</li>
    <li>Orange food coloring</li>
    <li>M&M's</li>
<ul>

<div style="display:flex;">
First, you need to melt your white chocolate. I like to use the type of chocolate pictured to the right. This one was from Walmart, but you can find the chocolate bark at most grocery stores. I like to melt my chocolate using a double boiler. It helps to heat the chocolate evenly so that it doesn't burn as easily. Also, by using a double boiler, the chocolate can stay hot for however long it takes you to dip all your pretzels. If you decide to melt your chocolate in the microwave, you may end up needing to melt it again if it starts to solidify. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/09/PumpkinPretzels/WhiteChocolateBark.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Once your chocolate is fully melted, add some orange food coloring. The amount you add is up to you, depending on how orange you want your pumpkins. Make sure to stir the chocolate and food coloring well so that you don‚Äôt have streaks of food coloring left. </p>
<p>Now you get to dip your pretzels. Because we are wanting to cover the entire pretzel, I like to toss a couple pretzels in, and then have a fork in each hand to pick up the pretzel and scrape off any excess chocolate. Once the pretzel is fully covered in chocolate, place it on some wax paper. The wax paper will prevent the chocolate from sticking. Before the chocolate hardens, add an M&amp;M to the top. To make the pretzel look like a pumpkin, I recommend using either green or brown M&amp;M‚Äôs. I ended up also using some orange ones too, because I didn‚Äôt have enough green and brown for all the pretzels I made. And I didn‚Äôt want to buy an entire extra bag of M&amp;M‚Äôs just for a couple colors. </p>
<p>Once you have dipped all your pretzels and added the M&amp;M‚Äôs, leave the pretzels to sit until the chocolate has hardened. This will probably take an hour or so to be fully hardened. Now you can enjoy! </p>

    <title>Rum Cake</title>

Rum Cake is a delicious, classic cake to have in your collection of recipes. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>It is perfect for almost any occasion, and is easy to make. </p>
<p>My mom made rum cake a lot when I was growing up, and it became one of our staples for our Christmas baking. This recipe in particular is very easy to make, because it uses a cake mix and instant pudding mix. </p>
<p>You start with a Golden Butter cake mix and a package of instant vanilla pudding. The Golden Butter cake mix is preferred, but recently I‚Äôve had trouble finding it in the grocery store. So if you can‚Äôt find a butter cake mix, you can use an ordinary yellow cake mix. Combine the cake mix and pudding mix in a bowl. </p>
<p>Then, mix in the eggs, rum, oil, and water until they are well combined. I have always used coconut rum for this recipe. It is my favorite, and I love the way it makes the cake taste. But, if you don‚Äôt have coconut rum, or if you prefer something else, you can add any rum you choose. </p>
<p>Make sure your cake pans are greased heavily, so that the cake does not stick. Pour your cake mix into your prepared pans. My mom always added chopped pecans after pouring in the batter. So you can do that if you wish. I never add the pecans. I have one friend who can‚Äôt eat them, and I know nut allergies are very common. Plus, I never cared for the nuts on the cake. </p>
<p>Then, you need to bake. If you‚Äôre making one large bundt cake, bake for 1 hour at 325¬∞F. If you‚Äôre making mini bundts, bake for 15 minutes, also at 325¬∞F. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Next, make the glaze. Combine the butter, sugar, water, and rum in a sauce pan. Heat this over medium heat, stirring continually until the sugar is dissolved and all ingredients are incorporated. Allow the glaze to boil for 2 minutes. Finally, poke holes in your cake and pour the glaze over the warm cake.

These Ritz sandwiches are incredibly delicious and so easy to make!

<br>

</a>

<p>Last night, we had some friends over for a game night, since Elayne was spending the night with her grandparents.<br>So of course, I made a bunch of food. I wanted to try out a few new recipes, one of which was these Ritz sandwiches. Everyone loved them! They are satisfying and delicious, kind of like an adult version of Lunchables. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
I love how easy they are to make. And, you can prep them ahead of time. Anyone who has ever cooked a bunch of food for a party or holiday knows that the last hour before guests arrive is always the most hectic. You're trying to get all the food cooked all at once so that it's hot and ready when people arrive. So it's helpful to have as much prepped ahead of time as possible. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/19/RitzSandwiches/RitzSandwiches2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Start by placing 48 Ritz crackers in the bottom of baking dishes. Then tear the ham into pieces, and place some ham on top of each cracker. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/02/19/RitzSandwiches/RitzSandwiches8.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/02/19/RitzSandwiches/RitzSandwiches1.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Then tear the swiss cheese into 1-inch squares. Place a square of cheese on top of the ham. Then place another Ritz cracker on top of the cheese.</p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/02/19/RitzSandwiches/RitzSandwiches4.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Melt the 5 tablespoons of butter in the microwave. Once melted, whisk in the dijon mustard, worcestershire sauce, and salt. Pour this mixture over the cracker sandwiches. Then, sprinkle poppy seeds and onion flakes over the sandwiches.</p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/02/19/RitzSandwiches/RitzSandwiches6.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Bake the sandwiches for 10-12 minutes, until the cheese is melted. The crackers are best served warm. </p>
<p>If you want to prep the sandwiches ahead of time, I recommend assembling the sandwiches with the crackers, ham, and cheese. But don‚Äôt pour the sauce over yet. You can refrigerate the sandwiches until it‚Äôs almost time to start baking. Then whisk together the sauce, pour it over the top, and sprinkle the poppy seeds and onion flakes right before baking. </p>

    <title>Salted Vanilla Toffee Cookies</title>

These cookies are yummy and sweet, with a fun salty note to them. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>I have always loved toffee, even though I don‚Äôt always think to have it. But it‚Äôs always satisyingly sweet and crunchy, and then even better when paired with chocolate. </p>
<p>I made these cookies for a friend‚Äôs birthday party this past weekend. I didn‚Äôt know most of the people there, but even so, everyone raved about them. It‚Äôs definitely a confidence boost when people I don‚Äôt know compliment my baking. Friends would be more likely to spare your feelings. Whereas, if a stranger doesn‚Äôt like your baking, they don‚Äôt have to say anything. I even had some people, who once they found out I made the cookies, say they thought the cookies had come from a professional bakery. So that was nice to hear. üòä </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
These cookies are not hard to make. They do require a little extra time for the dough to chill in the fridge. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/10/04/SaltedVanillaToffeeCookies/SaltedVanillaToffeeCookies1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Because the cookie dough needs to sit in the fridge for a few hours, we don‚Äôt need to preheat the oven or grease a baking sheet yet. So start by combining the flour, cornstarch, baking soda, and salt in a medium bowl. Set this bowl aside for a few minutes. </p>
<p>In the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the softened butter until it is very smooth. It‚Äôs important that the butter is soft. Otherwise, you will end up with lumps of butter instead of a smooth texture. Add in the sugar and brown sugar. Beat until it‚Äôs fluffy and light in color. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Now, you need to scrape the seeds from the vanilla bean. Slice the bean lengthwise, and then use the tip of the knife to scrape out the seeds. The vanilla bean can be hard and somewhat difficult to cut. So just be careful not to cut your fingers. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/10/04/SaltedVanillaToffeeCookies/SaltedVanillaToffeeCookies2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Now add the vanilla bean seeds, vanilla, and eggs to your mixing bowl. Beat until all ingredients are incorporated. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/10/04/SaltedVanillaToffeeCookies/SaltedVanillaToffeeCookies3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, gradually add the flour mixture that has been set aside into your mixing bowl. Mix well between each addition of dry ingredients. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/10/04/SaltedVanillaToffeeCookies/SaltedVanillaToffeeCookies4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Finally, stir in the bag of Heath toffee bits. Cover the cookie dough, and place it in the fridge for at least 3 hours. This will allow the dough to harden so that it will not spread too much when baking.

After the dough is finished chilling, remove it from the fridge. Preheat the oven to 350¬∞F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Scoop the dough and roll it into 1-inch balls. Place the balls of dough on the baking sheet, and flatten it slightly with the palm of your hand. Sprinkle a little sea salt onto the cookie dough.

Bake the cookies for 8-9 minutes, until they are slightly golden in color. Allow the cookies to cool for a few minutes before removing them from the pan to cool completely.

<p>My only complaint about these cookies is that they tend to be difficult to remove from the pan. The toffee sticks to the pan, no matter how well you grease it. So when the toffee sticks, the cookies start to pull apart. When I made these, several of them ended up with some holes in the middle where the cookie started to tear apart. The best advice I can offer is to remove the cookies carefully, and use a good, thin spatula to remove them. Also, allow the cookies to cool some on the pan before attempting removal. Trying to move the cookies when they‚Äôre too hot makes them more fragile. </p>

Who doesn't love s'mores?? Now put them in a Rice Krispy Treat style, and you have all the delicious s'more taste without needing the campfire. 
<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>These S‚Äômore Crispy Treats are so easy to make, and everyone loves them. All you need for these delicious bars is Golden Grahams cereal, mini marshmallows, Hershey‚Äôs bars, some butter, and a pinch of salt. You essentially make them the same way you would make normal Rice Krispy Treats: melt the butter, add the marshmallows and melt them until smooth. Add in the cereal and stir til coated. The only step this recipe has that the traditional doesn‚Äôt, is to then stir in the chocolate Hershey‚Äôs bars pieces and some extra marshmallows. And then you press the entire mixture into a 9x13 pan and let it cool. Easy peasy. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
What I love about making any type of Rice Krispy Treat is that they only take about 5 minutes to make. There is very little measuring or prep involved, and you can have a dessert made quickly. They are perfect for last minute get-togethers, when you want to have something sweet on hand.

<p>The only part that some people may not like is that they are messy to make. When I‚Äôm finished making these, I typically have marshmallows all over my hands, and the pot is coated in marshmallow and chocolate. But really, it‚Äôs not that big of a deal. The marshmallow comes off my hands just fine. And if you leave the pot to soak in the sink for a little while, it becomes very easy to clean. </p>
<p>I will say, I <em>highly</em> recommend using mini marshmallows, especially for the marshmallows that are stirred in at the end. The last time I made these, my local grocery store was completely sold out of <em>all</em> mini marshmallows. All that were left were the big ones. Standing in the store, I figured, ‚ÄúNot a big deal. I‚Äôll just use big marshmallows and cut a few up to stir in. No problem at all.‚Äù I was wrong. Using big marshmallows to melt and mix with the cereal was simple. It was no different than using mini marshmallows. But when I went to cut up a few marshmallows to stir in, I realized my problem: Marshmallows have a powdery coating around the outside that prevent them from being sticky. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
As soon as I started cutting the marshmallows, they were sticking to my hands, my kitchen scissors, the bowl I was putting them in... It was a nightmare. Doable, but not recommended. Finally, after several minutes of struggling against the stickiness, I had my marshamllows cut and ready to go. Then I had to deal with the stickiness again when I went to stir them into my cereal mixture. I had to pull them off the edge of the bowl and then try to get them unstuck from my fingers and into the cereal. Once in the cereal, many of the marshmallows continued to stick together. All in all, it's possible, but not really worth it. If you can't find mini marshmallows at the grocery store, and you're left with only large marshmallows, here's my advice: Simply melt a few more marshmallows with your butter, and forgo stirring in marshmallows at the end.

Happy Thanksgiving!! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

</a>

<p>We celebrated this year by going to my parents‚Äô house. And since I don‚Äôt believe that my mom should have to do <i>all</i> the cooking, I offered to help. So, I made my favorite things: Mac &amp; Cheese and dessert üòä I decided to try a new recipe: S‚Äômores pie! </p>
<p>This pie was absolutely delicious! But also very, very rich. I actually wasn‚Äôt feeling very well on Thanksgiving, so I didn‚Äôt actually get to taste my pie until the next day. And even then, I could only eat a small piece because it was just so sweet. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
But everyone loved it, so I call that a win. And it was an easy dessert to make, especially since the recipe calls for a pre-made pie crust. If you're feeling like over-achieving, you can make your own pie crust using graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. It's easy enough, just some extra steps.
<div>
    <img src="/2022/11/25/SmoresPie/SmoresPie3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Add the chocolate chips to a heat-safe bowl. Heat the heavy cream over medium heat until just simmering. Pour the heated heavy cream over the chocolate chips, and let it sit about 5 minutes. Then stir until the chocolate is smooth. </p>

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Pour the chocolate into the bottom of the graham cracker crust. Refrigerate 20-30 minutes until set. While the chocolate is setting, start to make the filling.

S'mores and cupcakes: How could you go wrong? 
<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>I am a big fan of s‚Äômores. I have tried several different s‚Äômore recipes: cupcakes, cakes, cookies, rice krispy treats. And every time I see a new s‚Äômore recipe, it peaks my interest. </p>
<br>

<div style="display: flex;">
These cupcakes are absolutely delicious, and they look very impressive once fully assembled. However, I will go ahead and note that this recipe is more time consuming than many others I post. Every once in a while, I get in the mood to really invest my time in a new recipe, and I will try something a little more tedious or complicated. These cupcakes take more time because they involve several steps. You have to make the cupcakes themselves. But then you have to make a chocolate ganache that then goes inside the cupcake. And you have to make the frosting too. And then of course garnish and decorate. Although they are a lot of effort, they are delicious! 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/04/17/SmoresCupcakes/SmoresCupcakes2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>For garnishment, I include a graham cracker, mini marshmallow, and piece of Hershey‚Äôs bar on top of the cupcake. I recommend not garnishing the cupcakes until right before serving them. When I made these the first time, I put all the toppings on right away. The chocolate and the marshmallow did fine. The problem was the graham cracker. Because it was sitting in the frosting overnight, it became soggy. It wasn‚Äôt the end of the world. It all still tasted good. But if you‚Äôre a perfectionist like me, you will want the graham cracker to still be crispy when served. </p>

            <li>Once cupcakes and ganache have both cooled, fill the cupcakes with the ganache. To do this, use a ¬º teaspoon to scoop out a section of the middle of the cupcake, about ‚Öì - ¬Ω of the way deep. Fill the hole with ganache.</li>
            <li>Make the frosting: Using an electric mixer, whip the heavy cream until thick, about 3-5 minutes. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla. Continue beating til stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Frost the cupcakes. Immediately before serving, add Hershey's chocolate, graham cracker, and mini marshmallow as garnish.</li>

    <title>Happy St. Patrick&#39;s Day!!</title>

Happy St. Patrick's Day!! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>I know that St. Patrick‚Äôs Day isn‚Äôt really a big deal in Atlanta, or in many places really. But I was born in Savannah, where it‚Äôs a really big deal. All the kids have the day off school. There is a huge parade, full of marching bands, floats, bagpipes, Irish dancers, and every other parade necessity. </p>
<p>Growing up, my family went to the parade every year. We would get up super early, head downtown, and set up our chairs to stake out our spot. We would have to sit around for hours, waiting for the parade to start, all so we could have good seats. </p>
<p>You may be thinking this sounds boring, sitting around for hours, waiting for the parade. But it really wasn‚Äôt. We would pack a bunch of food, have a breakfast picnic, do some people watching (there were always interesting people around to watch), buy a bunch of green items from the vendors around, and go for walks around the downtown area. </p>
<p>I miss being in Savannah for St. Patrick‚Äôs Day, and I‚Äôm hoping we‚Äôll be able to take Elayne to the parade next year. I think she would have a lot of fun watching all the excitement. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
This year, we had a relaxing day at home. Tommy took the day off work, not for St. Patrick's Day, but because a new video game came out today (of course üòõ). 
<div>

<div style="display:flex;">
We did go out to breakfast as a family, and Elayne got all the compliments about her adorable green shamrock dress. 
<div>

<p>Elayne was also in a really good mood today. She had a lot of fun pretending to cook with her bowls and spoons, and eating at her new Minnie Mouse table. </p>

Every baker needs a good, classic sugar cookie recipe. 

<br>

</a>

<p>These cookies are simple, sweet, and addictive. They are loved by adults and children alike. You can eat them plain, or top them with frosting and sprinkles. </p>
<p>I recently made these cookies for my neighborhood‚Äôs Children‚Äôs Fall Festival event. I made both chocolate chip and sugar cookies. I figured, these were safe options that kids would love. It seems I was right. I had so many compliments about the cookies, and I had several kids asking their parents if they could have more. Gotta say, that made me feel good. </p>
<p>Like any sugar cookies, these are easy to make, and don‚Äôt take too much time either. The most tedious part is rolling the dough in sugar. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
No special ingredients are needed - just things you would find in most bakers' pantries. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/11/14/SugarCookies/SugarCookie5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set this bowl aside for later. 
In a large bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the softened butter and sugar until the mixture is smooth. Then, add in the egg yolks and vanilla. Mix until it's combined. 
Slowly add in the flour mixture, mixing between each addition. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/11/14/SugarCookies/SugarCookie6.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Scoop the dough into balls and roll into sugar. Place the dough on the greased baking sheet. Bake for 15-18 minutes at 350¬∞F, until the tops of the cookies begin to crack.<br>Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the pan before removing them to cool fully. </p>

    <title>Spinach Artichoke Bites</title>

These Spinach Artichoke Bites are a simple appetizer for when you have friends over.

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>It is very easy to throw together at the last minute, without needing any preparation beforehand. You can use the phyllo cups straight from the freezer - they don‚Äôt need to be thawed since you are going to be putting them in the oven. Also, I used a pre-made spinach artichoke dip from the grocery store, for simplicity since I was making a lot of food for our party. But if you‚Äôre feeling adventurous, you can make your own. Or, you could try another type of dip. Buffalo chicken dip maybe? </p>
<p>I don‚Äôt have any pictures of the process of making these, because I was scrambling trying to get them done as people were arriving for our housewarming party last weekend. This is an appetizer that is best served warm, so I recommend making it last-minute before guests arrive. Of course, having these last-minute appetizers can also be the most stressful for a hostess, no matter how simple they are. Because it always happens that you‚Äôre trying to get all the last-minute things done at once. Finish the final appetizers, put out the drinks on ice, make sure the kitchen is cleaned up, etc. The last 30 minutes before a party are the most stressful, no matter how well you prepared beforehand. </p>
<p>Anyways, they were still very easy. I actually asked some friends to help me make them, because I was running around like crazy. </p>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 375¬∞F. Place the phyllo cups on an ungreased baking sheet. Place a small spoonful of spinach artichoke dip into each phyllo cup. Top the dip with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and panko breadcrumbs. </p>
<p>Bake for 12-16 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the breadcrumbs are toasted. That‚Äôs it - you‚Äôre done! Serve them warm and let your guests enjoy üòä </p>

    <title>Sweet Potato Sausage Skewers</title>

These skewers are a delicious, easy appetizer to make for your next get-together!

</a>

<div style="display:flex;">
I am a huge fan of sweet potatoes. They are very easily my favorite vegetable. Give me sweet potato fries over regular fries any day. At home, I frequently roast sweet potatoes to have as a side with our dinners. That's why I love this appetizer. This is another recipe I made for our game night yesterday. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/19/SweetPotatoSausageSkewers/SweetPotatoSausageSkewers2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>They are a little tedious to make, just because you need to assemble all the skewers. But, you can still prep ahead of time. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
First, preheat the oven to 425¬∞F. Next, peel the sweet potatoes. Cut them into 1-inch cubes. Toss the sweet potatoes with 2 teaspoons of olive oil, the brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix this up until the potatoes are evenly coated. Arrange the sweet potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, turning halfway through, until the potatoes are tender. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/19/SweetPotatoSausageSkewers/SweetPotatoSausageSkewers4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
While the sweet potatoes are cooking, whisk together the Greek yogurt and dijon mustard in a small bowl. Set the sauce aside until it's time to serve the skewers. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/19/SweetPotatoSausageSkewers/SweetPotatoSausageSkewers3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, cut the sausages into 1-inch slices. It's important that you get precooked sausages. This way, you only need to put them on the stove for a couple minutes to sear them and make sure they're hot. However, if you buy sausages that aren't precooked, you will need to make sure to cook them thoroughly. For precooked sausages, heat the remaining teaspoon of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the sausages to the heated pan. Allow the sausages to sear until crisp, making sure to flip them as needed. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/19/SweetPotatoSausageSkewers/SweetPotatoSausageSkewers5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Finally, assemble the skewers. Poke a toothpick through a sweet potato cube, followed by a slice of sausage. Place the skewer on a serving platter, and serve them with the dipping sauce. </p>

    <title>Sweet Potato Feta Bites</title>

I love sweet potatoes! Pair them with some feta cheese and a few other ingredients for a delicious and light appetizer.

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump"> 
    Jump to Recipe
</a>

<p>Whenever I am making food for a party or get-together of any kind, I try to have a good variety of foods available. So this means I have some sweet, some savory. I have some with meat, some vegetarian. And I have some heavier, some lighter. </p>
<p>These Sweet Potato Feta Bites are the perfect light appetizer. They are easy to make, and they are just so satisfying to eat. Maybe I‚Äôm a little biased because I just love sweet potatoes in practically any form, but I thought they were absolutely delicious! </p>
<p>Start by preheating your oven to 450¬∞F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.<br>Then peel and slice your sweet potatoes into ¬Ω-inch rounds. The sweet potatoes I found at the store were <i>massive</i>, so I decided to cut some of the sweet potato rounds into halves, or even quarters for the really big ones. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/08/18/SweetPotatoFetaBites/SweetPotatoFetaBites2.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Place the sweet potato rounds onto the prepared baking sheet, with the scooped-out well facing up. Brush the tops of the sweet potatoes with olive oil, and sprinkle Italian seasoning on them. Bake them for about 25 minutes, until the edges are just starting to brown. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/18/SweetPotatoFetaBites/SweetPotatoFetaBites4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>While the sweet potatoes are baking, mash together the feta cheese, sour cream, Greek seasoning, and scallions in a medium bowl. I found Greek seasoning at my local grocery store in the section with all the other spices. If you‚Äôre having trouble finding some, it may be with the spices or in the international aisle. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
When the sweet potatoes are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Place a small spoonful of the feta mixture into the well of each sweet potato. Place the baking sheet back in the oven for another 5 minutes, or until the cheese is starting to melt. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/18/SweetPotatoFetaBites/SweetPotatoFetaBites1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Serve the bites immediately when they are finished baking so that they will still be hot. </p>
<p>If you are making these bites for a party, I know how crucial it can be to prep as much as possible ahead of time. So luckily, this appetizer can be prepped early too. If you‚Äôre making them ahead of time, you can scoop out the center of the sweet potatoes and bake them. Then add the feta mixture on top of the potatoes and place them in the fridge until closer to your party. Before baking them again, bring the pan out of the fridge and all the potatoes to come to room temperature. Then bake for the remaining 5 minutes to melt the cheese.</p>

    <title>Turtle Treats</title>

A different take on the previously posted Pretzel Treats, these Turtle Treats are another bit hit. 
<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>These Turtle Treats are exactly like the Pretzel Treats, except they use Rolos instead of Hershey‚Äôs Hugs and pecans instead of M&amp;M‚Äôs. They are so satisfying because they give you the perfect salty and sweet mixture, plus the creamy caramel. </p>
<p>When I was younger, I didn‚Äôt care for this variation, probably because it contained nuts, and I used to be a picky eater. But now that I‚Äôm older, and enjoy a much wider variety of foods, I really enjoy these. They are typically included in my holiday baking and sometimes for parties as well. They are so easy to make, how could they not be a go-to party snack? </p>
<p>Just like with the Pretzel Treats, the most time consuming and tedious part of making the Turtle Treats is unwrapping all the Rolos. I like to do this ahead of time, while I‚Äôm sitting on the couch watching TV. It makes the whole task much more enjoyable. </p>
<div style="display: flex;">
The steps to make the Turtle Treats are the same as the Pretzel Treats. We start by lining a baking sheet with square pretzels, and then place an unwrapped Rolo on the center of each pretzel. The square pretzels work best to keep the chocolate from seeping through to the baking sheet. Keeping the Rolo to the center of the pretzel prevents the treats from sticking together too much, although this is not as big of an issue with the Turtle Treats as it is with the Pretzel Treats. This is because the Rolos do not spread nearly as much as the Hershey's Hugs. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/04/11/TurtleTreats/Pretzels.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Next, bake the pretzels for about 5 minutes at 150¬∞F, or until the center of the Rolo is soft. To test this, I take a pecan and press it into one of the Rolos in the middle of the pan. It if presses in easily, they are ready to come out of the oven. </p>
<p>Immediately after taking the pan out of the oven, press a pecan into each Rolo. This needs to be done before the chocolate cools too much. When selecting pecans from the bag, I try to select the ones that are not broken, just to make the treats look better. But using pecan pieces works just as well. Then allow the chocolate to cool and harden. You can do this by allowing it to cool at room temperature, or by placing the baking pan in the refrigerator. </p>

Happy Valentine's Day!! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>Valentine‚Äôs Day is a little different for us these days. Not that we ever did a whole lot before Elayne was born. Tommy and I used to go out to a nice dinner either the day before or the day after Valentine‚Äôs Day. It was just easier, and we both preferred not having to fight for reservations. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
This year, we just stayed home for dinner. It was easier. 
Elayne and I had an enjoyable, relaxing day today though. We went to Whole Foods. Elayne loves to go there and see everything. She had fun looking at the hundreds of flowers they had out. 
<div>

</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Later in the day, after Tommy was done working, we played ball out on the driveway. We didn't have enough time to walk down to the park today, because Elayne had trouble going to sleep for her nap, so her whole nap time got shifted a little later. But, we did take a stroll down our street, with Elayne holding onto both mine and Tommy's hands. ü•∞

By the end of the evening, Elayne was worn out!

<p>I did decide to make this <a href="/2023/02/14/VanillaBeanCremeBrulee/" title="Vanilla Bean Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e">Vanilla Bean Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e</a> for dessert for Tommy and me. Tommy isn‚Äôt much of a sweets person, but he does really like Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e. </p>
<p>If I‚Äôm being honest, the Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e didn‚Äôt turn out quite as well as I hoped. It had a delicious flavor, but I slightly undercooked it, so it was a little runny in the very middle. And I‚Äôm still working on my technique with caramelizing the sugar on top. So I over-caramelized it a little. But hey, it‚Äôs a work in progress. Tommy says I just need to practice more and make Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e more often. üòõ</p>

    <title>Triple Chocolate Mousse Cake</title>

This Triple Chocolate Mousse Cake is an indulgent dessert that is sure to attract attention. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>Since we were having some of Tommy‚Äôs coworkers over the other night, I decided I wanted to try a slightly more intricate dessert than just making cookies. So I decided to try a mousse cake, having never made mousse cake before. I was very nervous that it wouldn‚Äôt turn out well, made extra nervous by the fact that I had never met Tommy‚Äôs coworkers and wanted to make a good impression. </p>
<p>I guess I didn‚Äôt need to worry nearly as much as I did. Everyone loved the cake! Some people even had a second piece. I was so excited! </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
This cake is a little more involved than other recipes I've blogged about, but it isn't actually difficult. Just more steps and more time-consuming. One ingredient you'll need that you may not have worked with before is unflavored gelatin. You can find it by the jello at your grocery store. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake23.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350¬∞F. Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan. Then, line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. Next, wrap the springform pan with two layers of aluminum foil. Place the springform pan into a larger pan, and fill the larger pan with about an inch of hot water. Baking the cake in a pan of water helps prevent the edges of the cake from drying out. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake22.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Now that your pan is prepared, make the cake. Start by melting the 10 ounces of semisweet chocolate in a large microwavable bowl until it‚Äôs smooth. Set the chocolate aside for a moment. Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add in half of the sugar and beat on low speed, increasing speed until the mixture is fluffy. Add in the remaining sugar, salt, and vanilla. Continue beating until all ingredients are mixed and soft peaks form. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake19.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Stir softened butter into the melted chocolate. Then mix in the egg yolks. Gently fold half of the sugar mixture into the chocolate mixture until fully mixed in. Then fold in the rest of the sugar mixture. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake17.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 26-28 minutes. The cake is finished baking when you can insert a toothpick into the center and have it come out clean. Allow the baked cake to cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate the cake for an hour. When the cake cools, it will sink some; this is normal. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake16.jpg" class="side-by-side">

    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake14.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>After the cake is cooled, run a knife around the perimeter of the pan to loosen the cake from the edges. Unlock the springform pan and remove the outer ring. Invert the cake onto a serving platter. Remove the bottom of the pan and the parchment paper. Place the springform ring back around the cake to serve as a mold for the mousse. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake11.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<p>Next, it‚Äôs time to make the semisweet chocolate mousse. Place the 10 ounces of semisweet chocolate into a large microwavable bowl. Set this bowl aside for a moment. </p>
<p>In a small bowl, mix together 1 teaspoon of unflavored gelatin and 2 tablespoons of cool water. Set it aside and allow it to form a jelly-like texture. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Next, pour half a cup of heavy cream in a small pan. Bring to a boil. Once boiled, pour the hot cream over the set-aside chocolate. Stir until the cream and chocolate are fully mixed and the chocolate is completely melted. If necessary, place the bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time to get the chocolate to finish melting.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake10.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>In a pan over low heat, allow the softened gelatin to melt, stirring constantly. Pour the melted gelatin into the melted chocolate mixture. </p>
<p>Pour the remaining one cup of heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer. Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate until fully incorporated. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake7.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake6.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Spread the mousse over the top of the cooled cake. Place the cake back in the fridge while making the white chocolate mousse. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake5.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Now you need to make the white chocolate mousse. To do this, follow the same steps as for the semisweet chocolate mousse, except with white chocolate. Spread the white chocolate mousse over the top of the semisweet chocolate mousse layer. Place the cake back in the fridge and allow to cool at least 4-5 hours, or overnight. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake4.jpg" class="side-by-side">
    <img src="/2023/08/13/TripleChocolateMousseCake/TripleChocolateMousseCake3.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Before serving, run a knife around the perimeter of the cake to prevent the edges from sticking to the pan. Open the lock of the springform pan and remove the outer ring. Use a vegetable peeler to shave curls off the semisweet chocolate bar for a garnish.

<p>I will be honest, it was a bit of a pain to make. Particularly making the vanilla bean paste. But, the food processor I used was a small, cheap one. I‚Äôm planning to get myself a better, full-size food processor. And I‚Äôm hoping that will make this better. </p>
<p>But, if you don‚Äôt want to make the vanilla bean paste, you can buy vanilla bean paste at the grocery store instead. However, it is pretty expensive. From what I‚Äôve seen, it looks like it‚Äôs about 25-30 dollars for a small bottle. </p>
<p>Tommy really liked this Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e, and he has asked that I make it again for his birthday in May. So I will definitely be investing in a better food processor. And I‚Äôm hoping that the next time making it will be better. Even though it was a good bit of effort to make, the custard itself had a delicious flavor! We both really enjoyed it. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
So where do we start? 
Cr√®me Br√ªl√©e does not require all that many ingredients. Most of them you would already have in your pantry. You just need to make sure you have the heavy cream, vanilla beans, and agave nectar.

</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
In addition to the ingredients shown above, you will also need some small ramekins to hold your custard. I would also recommend a butane torch to caramelize the sugar. However, if you don't have a butane torch, you can use the broiler in your oven instead.

</div>
</div>

<p>We need to start by making the vanilla bean paste. I chopped the vanilla beans into small pieces so that the food processor could break them down faster. Then, add the vanilla beans, agave nectar, and vanilla to the food processor. Run the food processor until the vanilla beans are broken down and the mixture is mostly smooth. Then strain the mixture into a small bowl so that you can remove the larger vanilla bean pieces. Press down on the remaining vanilla bean pieces in order to press out as much liquid as possible. Set the vanilla bean paste aside for future use.</p>

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
In a small pot over low heat, stir together the heavy cream and salt. Heat until the mixture is hot, but not boiling. Then remove the pot from the heat and mix in 1 tablespoon of the vanilla bean paste.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/14/VanillaBeanCremeBrulee/VanillaBeanCremeBrulee10.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Using an electric mixer, beat the egg yolks and sugar until the mixture is lightened. With the mixer on low speed, very slowly pour the heated cream mixture into the egg/sugar mixture. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/14/VanillaBeanCremeBrulee/VanillaBeanCremeBrulee12.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Divide the custard mixture evenly between 4 small ramekins. Then place the ramekins in an oven-safe baking dish. Fill the baking dish with warm water until it reaches halfway up the ramekins. 
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/14/VanillaBeanCremeBrulee/VanillaBeanCremeBrulee3.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Bake the custard for 40-45 minutes, until the custard is mostly set, and the center barely jiggles. Remove the ramekins from the water, and allow them to cool at room temperature for at least 30 minutes. Then transfer the ramekins to the refrigerator and allow them to chill at least 3-4 hours.
<div>
    <img src="/2023/02/14/VanillaBeanCremeBrulee/VanillaBeanCremeBrulee4.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>Immediately before serving, remove the ramekins from the fridge. Top each one with about ¬Ω teaspoon of sugar. You want to spread the sugar out so that a very thin layer of sugar covers the entire top of the custard. Then use a butane torch to caramelize the sugar. I always struggle with getting the sugar to melt and caramlize evenly. Some spots always get darker than others. But it will get better with practice. You want the sugar to turn an amber color. Once it is melted and amber in color, turn off the torch and allow it to sit for just a minute. The sugar will harden, and you will have the distinctive crunchy top to your cr√®me br√ªl√©e. </p>
<p>If you don‚Äôt have a butane torch, place the ramekins under the broiler in your oven. You will need to watch them closely to make sure the sugar is not burning. Once the sugar is melted, remove them from the oven.</p>

<div class="post-body">
Last week, Tommy, Elayne, and I officially moved into our new house! 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<p>The past few weeks have been very hectic! Between getting our old house ready to list, doing a couple projects in our new house, moving all our furniture and boxes, and finally trying to get everything unpacked and settled, we have been exhausted! </p>
<p>Our new house is still a wreck. But I‚Äôm slowly getting all the boxes unpacked and attempting to organize everything. It is a much more challenging process while also trying to keep a toddler entertained. So because of this, her toys are spread all throughout the house! </p>
<p>At least Elayne seems to be enjoying her new home. We have a much bigger backyard now, and she loves running around in the grass. We‚Äôve also enjoyed sitting on the porch, and just exploring the new house in general. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">

</div>

<p>We love the new area we‚Äôre in, and the people we‚Äôve met seem great. We are going to miss our old neighbors though. It‚Äôs always bittersweet to leave a house you love and have lived in for years. But we‚Äôre exciting for what the future holds. </p>
<p>Due to all the craziness lately, I haven‚Äôt had any time to bake. But don‚Äôt worry - I will be back to it soon! New recipes are coming - I promise! </p>

    <title>White Chocolate Macadamia Nut Cookies</title>

If you're a fan of white chocolate and nuts, these are the cookies for you!

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>Personally, white chocolate macadamia nut cookies have never been my favorite. I don‚Äôt dislike them, but if there is a different cookie option, I usually go with whatever else is available. Because of this, I had never actually made these cookies before, just never had a desire to. </p>
<p>Well, turns out they are my neighbor‚Äôs favorite, and he requested that I make them the next time I felt like baking. I was very pleased with how they turned out, and I realized that these are actually very good cookies. I had just never given them much chance compared to other cookies. But the white chocolate is rich and creamy, and the macadamia nuts are a nice balance to keep the cookie from being overindulgent. </p>
<p>For this recipe, you, of course, need white chocolate and macadamia nuts. I like to use white chocolate chips, mostly for convenience. However, if you‚Äôre feeling fancy and want to use a good-quality white chocolate bar, you can do that. You‚Äôll just need to chop it up first. You will also need to chop the macadamia nuts. Just a rough cut - they don‚Äôt need to be perfect or even very uniform. I like to cut mine until the largest pieces are roughly the size of the white chocolate chips. This is my preference because I don‚Äôt like biting into cookies and getting a big bite of nut. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
The rest of the recipe is similar to most cookie recipes. Cream together the butter and sugars until they are light and fluffy. Mix in the egg and vanilla. Then, add in the dry ingredients: flour, baking soda, and salt. 
Finally, stir in the white chocolate and macadamia nuts, roll the dough into balls, and bake. 
<div>
    <img src="/2022/05/04/WhiteChocMacadamiaNutCookies/WhiteChocMacNutCookies1.jpg" class="floating-image">
</div>
</div>

<p>It is recommended to refrigerate the dough before baking, but this is not strictly necessary. So why do so many cookie recipes recommend chilling the dough? Here‚Äôs why: When cookie dough is chilled, the butter hardens. Then, when the cookies are baked, it takes longer for the butter to soften and melt, leading to the cookies spreading less. Refrigerating the dough can be the difference between thick, chewy cookies or thinner, crispier cookies. </p>

These Watermelon Prosciutto Skewers are very easy - no baking required.

</a>

<p>These skewers offered a good variety to the other foods I made for our housewarming party. They are different than the typical appetizers I make. I don‚Äôt usually do too many cold appetizers, except for dips. But these were a good, light appetizer. And the watermelon was sweet, juicy, and perfect for summer. </p>
<div style="display:flex;">
Start by scooping the watermelon into balls using a melon baller. The melon ball I have has 2 different sizes. I used the smaller of the two, and it seemed to be a good size for the skewers. You will need 2 watermelon balls per skewer. Then cut your prosciutto pieces in half. Half of a slice will go on each skewer. 
<div>

<p>Next, assemble the skewers. On each skewer, add the ingredients in the following order:</p>
<ul class="post-body">
        <li>Watermelon ball</li>
        <li>Mozzarella pearl</li>
        <li>Prosciutto</li>

    <title>White Chocolate Cranberry Biscotti</title>
    <url>/2022/08/07/WhiteChocolateCranberryBiscotti/</url>
    <content><![CDATA[<img src="/2022/08/07/WhiteChocolateCranberryBiscotti/WhiteChocolateBiscotti9.jpg" class="top-image">
<div class="post-body">
Maybe it's just me, but I feel more sophisticated when eating biscotti, as opposed to a cookie or some other dessert. 

<br>
<span id="more"></span>

<a class="jump-to-recipe-btn" href="#recipejump">

</a>

<p>This White Chocolate Cranberry Biscotti is a delicious addition to a cup of coffee, tea, or even just to have on its own. It is a delicious treat that will impress whoever you are sharing it with. </p>
<p>Baking something new can sometimes feel daunting, especially if it‚Äôs something completely different that what you‚Äôre used to. If you typically only make cookies, biscotti might sound too complex or even intimidating. No worries! This biscotti recipe is not difficult. However, it is a little time consuming. </p>
<p>So, where do we start?<br>The dough is actually made very similarly to cookie dough. You cream together the butter and sugar until they are light and fluffy. Then, add the eggs and vanilla, and continue mixing til combined. Then, slowly add in your flour, baking powder, and salt. </p>
<p>Now, you get to add in the cereal and white chocolate. This recipe calls for Cranberry Almond Crunch cereal. It is a Post Great Grains cereal. I don‚Äôt usually have any trouble finding it at Publix. But, if you‚Äôre at the store and can‚Äôt find this one, I‚Äôm sure there will be something similar that will taste just as delicious! For the white chocolate, I like to buy a block of white chocolate and chop it up. But, if you‚Äôre short on time, or just want the convenience, white chocolate chips will work just as well. </p>

    <img src="/2022/08/07/WhiteChocolateCranberryBiscotti/WhiteChocolateBiscotti2.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>


<p>Now that the dough is completely mixed together, make sure your baking sheet is greased. Divide the dough in half, and form each half into an oval disc shape on your baking sheet. I find it easiest to add a little flour to my hands before trying to shape the dough. The dough gets very sticky, and it will be coating your hands very quickly without the flour. </p>

    <img src="/2022/08/07/WhiteChocolateCranberryBiscotti/WhiteChocolateBiscotti4.jpg" class="side-by-side">
</div>


<div style="display:flex;">
Bake the biscotti at 350¬∞F for 30 minutes, until it is slightly browning. 
Remove the biscotti from the baking sheet and place it on a large cutting board. The dough is still warm and therefore very soft. Make sure to move lift and move it very gently. I usually like to use 2 long spatulas for this. I place one under each side and lift. Once the biscotti is on the cutting board, allow it to cool there for 5 minutes.

After the biscotti is cooled, cut each disc diagonally into slices about half an inch thick. Make sure to do this with a serrated knife. I like to use a long, serrated bread knife.

Once the biscotti is sliced, place the slices back on the baking sheet upright, spaced slightly apart. Place them back in the oven to bake for an additional 15-18 minutes, until they are slightly dried. Once fully baked, remove them from the baking sheet and allow them to cool on wire racks.

<p>Once the biscotti is fully cooled, you can drizzle chocolate or dip them in chocolate. This step is optional, but highly recommended. I like to use dark chocolate, but milk chocolate tastes delicious too. I prefer drizzling the chocolate. The easiest way to do this, as I have found, is to keep the biscotti laid out on the wire racks. Place some wax paper underneath the racks to catch the chocolate that drips through. Then drizzle your chocolate over all the biscotti slices. It is still a messy process, but the wax paper helps a lot. </p>
