Recently, I've become a big fan of banana cream. Not sure where it came from, because I never really cared about it one way or the other until the past year or so. Now I love it. 

I made these muddy buddies when we had Tommy's coworkers over, and I received lots of compliments about them. They are addicting, and I could seriously just stand there munching until the whole bowl is finished.

This is an easy treat to make, not requiring many ingredients or baking experience. Start by measuring out 6 cups of Chex cereal into a large bowl.

<div style="display:flex;">
In a small pan, combine the butter, white chocolate chips, sweetened condensed milk, and milk. Heat over medium heat, stirring until the ingredients are melted and combined. Then add in the dry pudding mix, and stir until fully incorporated.

Pour the butter mixture over the Chex cereal. Stir until the Chex is fully coated. Transfer the Chex to a gallon ziploc bag. Add 1½ c powdered sugar into the ziploc bag.

<div style="display:flex;">
Seal the bag well, and shake it until the Chex are fully coated in powdered sugar. 
Spread the Chex out on waxed paper. Sprinkle the remaining ½ c powdered sugar over the top. Allow to harden, then serve immediatley.
