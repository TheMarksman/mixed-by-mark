Happy Easter!! ðŸ˜„

Today we had a lot of fun! 
I know this wasn't Elayne's first Easter, but it was the first one she could really participate in. And she absolutely loved it! 

<div style="display:flex;">
Last night, we dyed eggs. Elayne was very curious and loved seeing the eggs come out of the dye a different color. But she didn't have much patience to wait for the eggs to finish coloring.

When she got up this morning, she saw her Easter basket on the table, and her face lit up. She proceeded to pull out all the goodies from her basket to either play with them or throw them around. Then, she hunted for eggs in the living room. She had lots of fun finding them and then walking them over to her basket.

After the morning festivities, we went to my parents' house for brunch. And of course she loved seeing her Grandma, Pop, Gigi, and Aunt Lauren. As the baby of the family, she gets <i>all</i> the attention. And she received <i>another</i> Easter basket, and got to hunt for more eggs. So her day was made. ðŸ˜Š

Of course, since it was a holiday, and since we were meeting up with people, I had to do some baking. ðŸ˜„
I made some cute, easy treats that could actually be modified to be made any time of year. I made some {% post_link EasterSugarCookies Easter Sugar Cookies %} and {% post_link HaystackNests Haystack Nests %}.
