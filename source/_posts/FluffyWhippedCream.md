<div class="post-body">
Want to make a really fluffy whipped cream? 
<br>Here's the trick: 
Before making your whipped cream, place the mixing bowl (preferably metal) and beaters into the freezer. Allow them to come very cold before you start mixing. Also keep the cream in the fridge until ready to use. 

Having cream, bowl, and beaters cold will result in stiffer peaks and an overall fluffier whipped cream.
