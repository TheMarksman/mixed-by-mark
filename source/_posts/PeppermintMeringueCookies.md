These Peppermint Meringue Cookies are very peppermint-y! They are light and airy, and have a nice crisp, minty flavor. They are a fun and festive cookie for your holiday baking.

I had never made meringue before today. These cookies turned out pretty well, even without having made them before this. And, a great thing about this recipe is that you don't need many ingredients in order to make them.

<div style="display:flex;">
You start by preheating your oven to 200°F and lining a baking sheet with parchment paper. Then, in a large bowl of a stand mixer, using a whisk attachment, beat the egg whites, cream of tartar, peppermint extract, and salt on medium speed until soft peaks form. This takes about 6-7 minutes.

Then, gradually add the sugar into the egg white mixture, beating on high speed between each addition. After all the sugar is added, beat on high speed until stiff peaks form, about 6-8 minutes. You need to allow the meringue to beat for a while, so that enough air can be incorporated into the mixture. This is why meringue has a light and airy texture.

Now, you need to prepare the pastry bag so that the cookies can be piped onto the baking sheet. In order to get the swirled red and white coloring, we need to add red food coloring to the inside of the pastry bag. What I recommend doing is placing the pastry bag in a large cup, with the top of the pastry bag folded over the top of the cup. This helps to hold the pastry bag in place. This is a trick I like to use any I use pastry bags, whether it be for frosting, meringue, or anything else. It is much easier to spoon your filling into the bag if the bag is held open by the cup. 
So, with your pastry bag in your cup, use a small paintbrush or small knife to paint red food coloring stripes up the sides of the pastry bag.

Now, spoon the meringue into the prepared pastry bag. Pipe the meringue onto the baking sheet, making the cookies about 1 inch in diameter. Bake the meringue for 90 minutes, or until the meringue appears dry and firm when pressed lightly.
