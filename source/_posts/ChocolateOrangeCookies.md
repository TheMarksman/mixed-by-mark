Chocolate oranges used to be one of my favorite parts about Christmas time. I received one in my stocking every year when I was little. It wasn't Christmas without smashing a chocolate orange into the table to break apart. 

I took these cookies to my friend's birthday party over the weekend, and I got a lot of compliments. Chocolate and fruit is a great combination, and, maybe it's just me, but I always feel a little classy when I make dessert with fruit in it. It just always seems a little fancier or something. 

I like how the acidity of the orange help to cut some of the richness of the chocolate. It results in a nice balance that doesn't make you feel too guilty for eating. So that means we can eat more, right? ðŸ˜Š

Start by preheating the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. 

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, salt, baking powder, and baking soda. Set this bowl aside until needed. 

Wash and zest the orange. Using a stand mixer, beat together one cup of sugar with the softened butter, one tablespoon of orange zest, orange extract, and egg until well combined.

Then, gradually add the set aside flour mixture into the butter mixture, making sure to mix well between each addition.

In a small bowl, combine the remaining sugar and orange zest. Scoop the cookie dough and roll into 1-inch balls. Roll the balls of dough in the sugar/orange mixture, and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten the dough slightly with the palm of your hand.

Bake the cookies for 9-10 minutes, until the edges begin to harden. Allow the cookies to cool for a couple minutes before removing from the pan to cool completely.
