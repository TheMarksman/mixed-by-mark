This Chocolate Caramel Pretzel Bark is satisfyingly salty and sweet. And it is one of the easiest recipes you will ever make. Plus, it is completely addicting. I could easily stand there just munching on it all night if I didn't stop myself. 

You don't need many ingredients... or many baking skills for that matter. Start by preheating the oven to 325°F. Then, line a baking sheet with aluminum foil. Grease the foil with cooking spray. This will prevent the caramel from sticking to the pan and the foil. Then place pretzels on the baking sheet in a single layer, covering the entire sheet.

Honestly, the most difficult part of this recipe is the fact that you have to use the stove. In a small pot, melt the butter and brown sugar over medium-low heat until it comes to a boil. Allow the mixture to boil, stirring almost continuously for 3-4 minutes. Once it is finished boiling, pour the caramel mixture over the layer of pretzels. The caramel will spread out some as it bakes, so it's ok if the caramel doesn't cover every inch of pretzel. I will say, next time I make this, I will probably use a just slightly smaller baking sheet. I think it would have been just a little better if more of the pretzels were covered by the caramel.

Bake the pretzel bark for 8-10 minutes. The caramel will be very bubbly. Remove the pan from the oven and sprinkle the chocolate chips over the entire sheet.

Return the baking sheet to the oven for another 1-2 minutes, until the chocolate gets soft and melty. Remove the bark from the oven. Use a spatula to spread the chocolate in an even layer, covering all the pretzels and caramel.

Once all the chocolate is spread out evenly, place the baking sheet in the freezer for at least 30 minutes. This will allow the chocolate and caramel to harden. Once it is fully hardened and set, remove bark from the baking sheet, and peel off the aluminum foil. Break the bark into pieces.
