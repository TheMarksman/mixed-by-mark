These Prosciutto Apple Cheddar Wraps are incredibly easy, and they are a more unique appetizer than your typical chips and dip.

This was my first time making these, and I honestly wasn't sure if they would go over well or not. While I was wrapping the apples in prosciutto, I was thinking that the appetizers were much bigger and bulkier than I was originally planning. I was worried people wouldn't like that. But it turns out, they were very popular. 

Another positive about this recipe is that you can make them ahead of time, and then just pull them out of the fridge when it's time for your party to start. Having recipes that can be made ahead of time is so helpful when you're making lots of food for a party and everything needs to be ready all at the same time. 

Make sure to wash, core, and slice your apples. I sliced each apple into 16 slices, so that they aren't too thick. 

Slice the white cheddar. I didn't make my slices too thick. I tend to like cheese that is pretty thin, but thick enough to not fall apart when picked up. Place a slice of cheddar on top of an apple slice. 

Now, wrap the apple and cheddar with prosciutto. I chose to cut the prosciutto in half, so that I had long thin slices. 

Once all wraps are made, either serve immediately or place in the fridge until ready to serve.
