 Hi, welcome to the next phase of my life. 
 My name is Taylor Mark. I have a wonderful husband, Tommy, and a beautiful daughter, Elayne. 
 
 Up until this year, I have worked in the software industry, been self-sufficient, and have had the freedom to do most of what I wanted. 
 But now, I recently quit my job to stay home and raise my daughter. She is 5 months old, and I couldn't be more in love. 
 
 During pregnancy, I couldn't imagine how different my life would be once Elayne was born. But now here I am, a full-time stay-at-home mom. It is a little weird not going into an office everyday, or seeing any coworkers. But I'm not complaining. I get to spend everyday with my precious baby girl. I get to see how she changes and grows everyday. And believe me, she changes so fast. I am very lucky to be able to raise her instead of needing to work. 
 
 But as happy as I am to stay home with her, I did need something else to focus on, so that I didn't spend **_all_** my free time doing housework and watching tv. I have been baking since I was very young. Growing up, my mom always baked for the holidays, and as we got older, my sisters and I would help out. We all wanted to make baked goods for our friends, and it resulted in us making hundreds of different treats to hand out at school. 
 
Since then, I have continued baking for various events, or just for no reason at all. I like to host parties, game nights, football game viewings, etc. Prior to Covid, I hosted a Halloween party several years in a row. I hosted my sister's wedding shower, and a few birthday parties. Each time, I made all the food myself, simply because that's what I enjoy doing. For as long back as I can remember, I have found baking to be exciting and a great way to get my mind off my stress. I like to try new recipes, and then have my friends, neighbors, or coworkers give their opinions of them; they have been great guinea pigs over the years :) 

In this blog, I hope to share much of my baking knowledge, in addition to recipes I like. I will also include recipes for appetizers/finger foods, as these are my go-to party foods. I hope I can inspire some amateur bakers and party hosts.
