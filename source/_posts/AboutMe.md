Hi, welcome to the next phase of my life. 

<br>  
<!--more-->

My name is Taylor Mark. I have a wonderful husband, Tommy, and a beautiful daughter, Elayne. 

Up until this year, I have worked in the software industry, been self-sufficient, and have had the freedom to do most of what I wanted. 
But now, I recently quit my job to stay home and raise my daughter. She is 5 months old right now, and I couldn't be more in love. Her smile is contagious, and she loves to laugh.

During pregnancy, I couldn't imagine how different my life would be once Elayne was born. Obviously, I knew things would change - I just couldn't comprehend how much. So now here I am, a full-time stay-at-home mom. It is a little weird not going into an office everyday, or seeing any coworkers. But I'm not complaining. I get to spend everyday with my precious baby girl. I get to see how she changes and grows everyday. And believe me, she changes so fast. I am very lucky to be able to raise her instead of needing to work.

But as happy as I am to stay home with her, I did need something else to focus on, so that I didn't spend **_all_** of my little free time doing housework and watching tv. Even moms need their own hobbies. 

I have been baking since I was very young. Growing up, my mom always baked for the holidays, and as we got older, my sisters and I would help out. We all wanted to make baked goods for our friends for the holidays. But when you're handing them out at school, you also don't want to exclude people, and it resulted in us making hundreds of treats each year. 

<div style="display:flex;">
Since then, I have continued baking for various events, or just for no reason at all. I like to host parties, game nights, football game viewings, etc. Prior to Covid, I hosted a Halloween party several years in a row. I hosted my sister's wedding shower, and a few birthday parties. Each time, I made all the food myself, simply because that's what I enjoy doing. For as long back as I can remember, I have found baking to be exciting and a great way to get my mind off my stress. I like to try new recipes, and then have my friends, neighbors, or coworkers give their opinions of them; they have been great guinea pigs over the years ðŸ˜Š

In this blog, I hope to share much of my baking knowledge, in addition to recipes I like. I will also include recipes for appetizers/finger foods, as these are my go-to party foods. I hope I can inspire some amateur bakers and party hosts.
