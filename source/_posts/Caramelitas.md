I made these bars a couple weeks ago for Tommy's birthday. It's one of his favorite desserts. I used to make them a lot when we were in college and dating. And it has been years since I have made them, mostly because we try to eat healthier now, and I don't typically make many desserts just for us to have. But, since it was his birthday, I wanted to do something yummy for him.

They aren't difficult to make, and don't require too many ingredients. The main things you'll need that may not already be in your pantry or fridge are caramel squares and heavy cream.

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Line an 8x8-inch pan with aluminum foil. Grease the foil-lined pan with cooking spray.

Melt the butter in the microwave. In a medium bowl, combine the butter, brown sugar, and vanilla. Mix it til smooth. Then add in the flour, oats, baking soda, and salt. Stir til all ingredients are well-combined.

Press half of the oat mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Set the remainder of the dough aside. Bake for 10 minutes.

<div style="display:flex;">
While the crust is baking, unwrap the caramel squares. In a medium saucepan, combine the caramels and heavy cream. Heat over medium-low heat, stirring almost continuously, til the mixture is melted and combined.
<div>

Once finished baking, remove the oat mixture from the oven. Top with the chocolate chips.

</div>

Pour the caramel sauce evenly over the chocolate. 
Then, crumble the remaining dough over the top. I like to pinch off pieces of the dough, and then flatten them slightly, so that I can make the dough cover as much of the top area as possible. 
<div style="display:flex;">

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Bake the assembled dessert for 15 minutes, til the edges are slightly browned. Remove from the oven and let cool completely, at least 4 hours, until the caramel is set. You could also bake your dessert the night before, and allow it to set overnight.

When serving, I highly recommend placing some in a bowl and heating it slightly in the microwave. Then top it with some vanilla ice cream and eat with a spoon. That's how Tommy and I always enjoy it.
