I have been wanting to try some more breads lately. But of course, I also wanted something at least a little sweet. And I have been wanting apples a lot lately. So apple bread seemed like a good answer. 

<div style="display:flex;">
It is also very easy to make. It's not the type of bread that you have to knead or let rise. It is more like baking a cake, with batter instead of sticky dough.

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Grease a 9x5-inch loaf pan with cooking spray. 
In a medium bowl, combine together the dry ingredients: flour, baking powder, salt, baking soda, cinnamon, and sugar.

Next, add in the wet ingredients: milk, oil, and vanilla. Mix well until all ingredients are fully incorporated. 
Finally, add in the diced apples and mix well to combine. 
I chose to dice the apples finely, because I didn't want large chunks of apple in the bread. I prefer to have smaller pieces of apple throughout the entire loaf. 
<div style="display:flex;">

</div>

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. 
Bake the bread for 45-50 minutes, until you can stick a toothpick in the middle and have it come out clean.

</div>

Allow the bread to cool for 10-20 minutes before removing it from the pan. I like to use a plastic fork to separate the bread from the loaf pan. This also protects the pan from being scratched. 
Once the bread is out of the pan, allow it to cool fully. 

<div style="display:flex;">
After the bread is fully cooled, make the glaze. You could decide to have the bread without the glaze, but I think the glaze gives it the extra sweetness it needs. 
To make the glaze, whisk together the melted butter, powdered sugar, and milk. 
When I made the glaze, I used 2 tablespoons of milk. My glaze ended up being a little too thin. I recommend starting with 1 tablespoon first. Then add another ½ tablespoon, if desired.

<div style="display:flex;">
Finally, pour the glaze over the cooled bread. I recommend waiting for the glaze to dry before serving.
