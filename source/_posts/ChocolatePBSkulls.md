I have always loved Halloween. Of course I loved it as a kid. Free candy - who wouldn't love that?! 
But now even as an adult, I still find it fun. There are so many fun decorations, and trust me, my house is full of them right now. And I love thinking of fun costumes for us to wear, and seeing all the excitement of the kids. 

Prior to Covid, my husband and I threw a Halloween party several years in a row. It was always a lot of fun. And I think I liked it even more just because not as many people throw parties for Halloween. I mean, there are so many Christmas parties in December. Why try competing with all that? This year, we decided to throw another Halloween party again. So of course, I had to find lots of festive things to bake! 

<div style="display:flex;">
And Halloween has a lot of fun things you can bake! I found a silicone chocolate mold in the shape of skulls at Michaels, so I decided to make these Chocolate Peanut Butter Skulls. They are very easy to make. My only mistake was that I only bought one mold. So I had to make a few skulls at a time, let them harden, and then pop them out and make more. It was a pretty tedious process, but would have been much faster with another mold or two.

Start by making the peanut butter filling. In the bowl of a stand mixer, mix together the softened butter, peanut butter, graham cracker crumbs, and powdered sugar. The mixture will be thick and a little crumbly. This is good. Set aside the peanut butter filling until ready to use.

Next, melt the chocolate chips. Because I was only using one mold, I just melted a little chocolate at a time. Place the chocolate chips in a microwave-safe bowl. Microwave for 30 seconds, then stir. Heat again for another 30 seconds. If you're chocolate is not fully melted and smooth, continue microwaving for 15 second increments, stirring after each heating. 
Once the chocolate is fully melted, spoon a little chocolate into each skully mold, filling it about halfway full.

Next, take a pinch of the peanut butter filling, and place it in each skull mold. Then fill the mold the rest of the way up with more chocolate. Place the skulls in the fridge so that the chocolate can harden.

When the chocolate is fully hardened, you can pop out the skulls and serve them. I recommend removing them from the fridge a little while before serving. This way, the chocolate won't be too cold or hard to bite.
