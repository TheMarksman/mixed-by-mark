I have made these cookies several times, and every time I have received compliments. They are very simple, no over-the-top ingredients. The cinnamon flavor is pretty mild, so even people who aren't big on cinnamon can usually enjoy them. They are an easy cookie to have for any occasion where you're unsure what everyone will like. 

And they can be enjoyed with pretty much any food. Want a breakfast cookie? Coffee and cinnamon go great together ðŸ˜„ 

These cookies are also very easy to make. You don't need too many ingredients. Everything you need will typically be found in any baker's pantry. First, preheat the oven to 325Â°F, and grease your baking sheet. 

Melt the butter in a microwave-safe bowl. Cream together the melted butter and sugar. Then, add in the egg and vanilla; stir until all ingredients are combined. 

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, cinnamon, and baking powder. Slowly add the flour mixture to the sugar mixture, mixing between each addition. When I say to slowly add the flour, I usually add about Â¼ cup of flour at a time, and mix until it is mostly incorporated before adding more flour. I repeat this until all the flour is in. The reason I do this is to keep from making a mess. Have you ever tried to just dump the entire amount of flour in at once and turned on the mixer? Flour goes everywhere! Not a fun mess to clean up. 

Once all the flour is in, set the dough in the fridge to chill for 10-15 minutes. Allowing cookie dough to chill before baking prevents the dough from spreading too much in the oven. This way, you can end up with nice, thick cookies. 

<div style="display:flex;">
After the dough has chilled, roll out the dough into 1-inch balls and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 9 minutes, or until the cookies are just slightly set. Remove the cookies from the oven. While the cookies are still hot, use a spoon to gently press on the center of each cookie. This step is not strictly necessary, but it gives the cookies their sunken-in shape, which I like.
