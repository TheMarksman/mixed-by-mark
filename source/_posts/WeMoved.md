Last week, Tommy, Elayne, and I officially moved into our new house!

The past few weeks have been very hectic! Between getting our old house ready to list, doing a couple projects in our new house, moving all our furniture and boxes, and finally trying to get everything unpacked and settled, we have been exhausted! 

Our new house is still a wreck. But I'm slowly getting all the boxes unpacked and attempting to organize everything. It is a much more challenging process while also trying to keep a toddler entertained. So because of this, her toys are spread all throughout the house! 

At least Elayne seems to be enjoying her new home. We have a much bigger backyard now, and she loves running around in the grass. We've also enjoyed sitting on the porch, and just exploring the new house in general.

We love the new area we're in, and the people we've met seem great. We are going to miss our old neighbors though. It's always bittersweet to leave a house you love and have lived in for years. But we're exciting for what the future holds. 

Due to all the craziness lately, I haven't had any time to bake. But don't worry - I will be back to it soon! New recipes are coming - I promise!
