We celebrated this year by going to my parents' house. And since I don't believe that my mom should have to do <i>all</i> the cooking, I offered to help. So, I made my favorite things: Mac & Cheese and dessert ðŸ˜Š I decided to try a new recipe: S'mores pie! 

This pie was absolutely delicious! But also very, very rich. I actually wasn't feeling very well on Thanksgiving, so I didn't actually get to taste my pie until the next day. And even then, I could only eat a small piece because it was just so sweet. 

<div style="display:flex;">
But everyone loved it, so I call that a win. And it was an easy dessert to make, especially since the recipe calls for a pre-made pie crust. If you're feeling like over-achieving, you can make your own pie crust using graham cracker crumbs and melted butter. It's easy enough, just some extra steps.

Add the chocolate chips to a heat-safe bowl. Heat the heavy cream over medium heat until just simmering. Pour the heated heavy cream over the chocolate chips, and let it sit about 5 minutes. Then stir until the chocolate is smooth.

Pour the chocolate into the bottom of the graham cracker crust. Refrigerate 20-30 minutes until set. While the chocolate is setting, start to make the filling.

In a large bowl, beat together the softened cream cheese, marshmallow fluff, and vanilla until it's smooth. Then, fold in the thawed whipped topping by hand.

Spread the filling over the set chocolate. Refrigerate 2-3 hours until the filling is set. Finally, once the filling is set, sprinkle graham cracker crumbs over the top.
