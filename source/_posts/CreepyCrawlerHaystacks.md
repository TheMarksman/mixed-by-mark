They don't need many ingredients, and they are so easy to make. Elayne even helped me make them. She helped stir the melted chocolate and chow mein noodles together. 

They are a fun treat for kids and adults alike. Let's be real, candy eyes always make treats fun. 

<div style="display:flex;">
To make them, start by spreading a sheet of wax paper on a baking sheet. The wax paper prevents the chocolate from sticking.

<div style="display:flex;">
In a microwave-safe bowl, melt the milk chocolate wafers. Heat them for 30 seconds at a time, stirring after each heating, until they are fully melted and smooth. Then mix in chow mein noodles until they are fully coated in chocolate. Make sure there are enough noodles so that there isn't a puddle of chocolate in the bottom of the bowl.

Scoop out mounds of chocolate chow mein noodles onto the wax paper. Top each mound with 2 candy eyes. Allow the creepy crawlers to harden before serving or storing. It is important for the chocolate to be set so that it doesn't smear everywhere.

Repeat the above steps with the dark chocolate and white chocolate. This way, you'll have creepy crawlers in multiple colors. However, if you're pressed for time, or prefer only one type of chocolate, you can make all your creepy crawlers with one chocolate.
