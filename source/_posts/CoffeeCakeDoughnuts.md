How could you not love coffee cake, especially when it has a delicious crumbly streusal topping? How about it we combine that with a doughnut?!

Today I decided to make both these Coffee Cake Doughnuts and some {% post_link GlazedDoughnuts Glazed Doughnuts %}. I think they both turned out pretty damn well.

Just like the Glazed Doughnuts, these Coffee Cake Doughnuts are baked instead of fried. So they are more dense, like a cake, instead of being fluffy and airy like doughnuts you'd get from Krispy Kreme. But they have a delicious crumb topping and a sweet glaze on them. 

<div style="display:flex;">
The doughnuts are easy to make, and they require ingredients that most bakers would already have in their pantry or fridge. Unlike the glazed doughnuts, these doughnuts also require sour cream. And this was the one ingredient I didn't already have at home, so I had to take Elayne to Publix before we could start our baking! 
In the picture to the right, the espresso powder is not pictured. I completely forgot to pull it out before taking the picture! ...And I didn't realize it until much later... Oops...

Start by preheating the oven to 350Â°F. Grease your doughnut pan with nonstick cooking spray.
Next, you need to make the crumb topping. In a small bowl, combine the sugar, flour, and cinnamon. Chop up your cold butter into tiny pieces, and add these butter pieces to your sugar mixture. Stir them into the mixture until the dry ingredients & butter combine into a clumpy mixture. Chill the crumb topping in the freezer while you make the doughnut batter.

Now we need to make the doughnut batter. Start by whisking together the flour, brown sugar, salt, baking powder, and espresso powder in a large bowl.

In a separate bowl, whisk together the sour cream, melted butter, and egg. Add the wet ingredients to the dry ingedients, and mix until they're just combined.

Spoon the batter into the doughnut pan, filling it about halfway full. This batter is thicker than the batter for the Glazed Doughnuts, so I chose to just spoon in the batter. But you could also pipe it if you would prefer. Once the batter is in the pan, top each doughnut with some of the crumb topping from the freezer.

Bake the doughnuts for 10-12 minutes. They are ready when you can insert a toothpick and have it come out clean. Let the doughnuts cool in the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

I will admit, I messed up a little when making these. I was distracted by Elayne, trying to keep her happy, while also attempting to keep her out of all the cabinets that I have not gotten around to babyproofing yet! So I completely forgot to add the crumb topping onto my doughnuts before baking them!! ðŸ«¢ I realized my mistake when I pulled them out of the oven. So I quickly added some crumb topping and put them back in the oven for a few more minutes. The crumb topping didn't bake as much as it is supposed to, but it still tasted yummy! 

Next, make the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla. If the glaze is too thick, you can add a little more milk until you reached your desired consistency. You want the glaze to be decently runny, so that it will cover the doughnut but not glob on top of it. 
Once the doughnuts are completely cool, drizzle the doughnuts with the glaze. Allow the glaze to set for about 30 minutes before serving.
