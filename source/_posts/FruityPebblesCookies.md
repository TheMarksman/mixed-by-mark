I love cereal! Especially the very sugary, not-good-for-you cereals. Fruity Pebbles has always been one of my (many) favorites! These cookies have the delicious sweetness of the Fruity Pebbles, in addition to the sugary taste of cookie dough.

This past weekend, my mom, sister, Elayne, and I all went to Dahlonega for the Gold Rush Festival. We drove up Saturday morning, went shopping at the festival, went out to lunch, and then stayed the night at a hotel and had a girls night. So of course, I wanted to bring some yummy treats for us to eat while we hung out. It was a lot of fun, and we all enjoyed the cookies.

I will say, because these cookies are so sweet, they are best when you only have a little at a time. So no shoving cookie after cookie down your throat. Unless that's what you like, then you be you. ðŸ˜Š 

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by combining the flour, baking powder, and salt in a medium bowl. Set this aside until ready to use.

In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the softened butter, sugar, and brown sugar until it's light and fluffy. 
Then add the eggs and vanilla. Mix again until all ingredients are combined.

Next, gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing well between each addition of flour. Doing this step gradually prevents a mess from flour flying everywhere. When all the flour is added, the dough will be thick - this is ok.

<div style="display:flex;">
Gently stir in the Fruity Pebbles cereal by hand until it is well mixed in. Place the cookie dough in the fridge and allow it to chill for 30 minutes.

After the dough has chilled, preheat the oven to 350Â°F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. 
Scoop the dough into 1-inch balls, and place them on the prepared baking sheet. 
Bake for 8-9 minutes, until the edges of the cookies begin to turn golden.

Allow the cookies to cool for a couple minutes on the pan, before removing to cool completely.
