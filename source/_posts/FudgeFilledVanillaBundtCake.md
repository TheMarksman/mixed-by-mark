I'm 30!! <br>
To celebrate, I had some friends over for a small party. And of course, I made a bunch of food and a cake. Because no birthday is complete without cake.

For my birthday, I decided to try a fudge-filled vanilla bundt cake. It turned out very well - rich and fudgy, and then topped with a sweet glaze. It was the type of cake that I wouldn't make unless having people over, because there is no way I'd be able to finish it all myself. 

<div style="display:flex;">
It was a little time consuming, because in addition to making the cake batter, I also had to make the fudge filling and the sugary glaze. But, the good thing about having a glaze is that I didn't have to worry about piping icing, or really decorating at all.

So how do we make a cake like this? 
First, you need to heavily grease and flour your bundt pan. If your pan is not adequately greased and floured, the cake will stick, and it will not come out of the pan looking pretty. If you don't know how to do this, see my post {% post_link GreaseFlourPans How to Grease & Flour Cake Pans %}.

Now we start with the cake ingredients. Using a stand mixer, cream together butter and sugar until it's light and fluffy. Once the butter and sugar are fully creamed together, add in the eggs and vanilla. Mix until all ingredients are combined. Then, add in the baking powder and salt, and mix until combined. 

<div style="display:flex;">
Now, we need to add in the flour and milk. The best way to do this is to add them in small amounts, mixing between each addition. If you dump all the flour into the bowl and turn the mixer on, flour will go everywhere! Once all the flour is added, mix until the batter is smooth. Set the batter aside until it's time to assemble the cake.

Next, start on the fudge filling. Using the stand mixer, beat the cream cheese until it's smooth. Then, melt the chocolate chips, and add them to the cream cheese. Mix until they are combined and smooth. Add in the egg, and beat until the fudge is creamy.

Once we have the fudge filling made, we need to assemble the cake. 
Spread half of the cake batter into the prepared bundt pan. Then, spoon the fudge mixture into the middle of the bundt pan. Make sure the fudge stays in the middle, and does not touch the outsides of the pan. Then, spread the remaining cake batter on top of the fudge. Make sure to fully cover the fudge with the cake batter.

Bake the cake for 50-55 minutes, until the cake is set. To tell if it's set, insert a toothpick into the middle of the cake. If it comes out clean, the cake is done and ready to be removed from the oven. 
After removing the cake from the oven, allow it to cool for about 10 minutes before attempting to remove it from the pan. After the cake has been out of the oven for a few minutes, I like to use a plastic fork to pull the cake away from the edges of the pan. This helps to loosen the cake so that it will come out more easily. Invert the pan onto a serving platter or cake stand while the cake is still warm.
