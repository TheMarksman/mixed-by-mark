Whether you're the type of host who likes to make all the food from scratch (like me), or you're just needing to throw something together before a few friends come over, this dip will be perfect for you. 

We were having a couple friends over to watch an Atlanta United game one night. We had planned to just order some pizza and make it a very simple, casual night. But, of course, I figured it would be good to have a little appetizer before the pizza. And I was right ðŸ˜Š 

<div style="display:flex;">
It was sooo easy to make, and since it's served cold, I was able to make it ahead of time and just pull it out the fridge when our friends arrived. And it doesn't require too many ingredients either. Everyone loved it! My friends even asked for the recipe so that they could make it at home.

Here's how you make it: 
First, use a hand mixer to beat together the cream cheese, sour cream, and Ranch mix until they are well combined and the mixture is smooth. Spread this mixture into the bottom of a pie dish (or really, any medium-sized serving dish will work).

<div style="display:flex;">
Then you'll need to chop up your Romaine lettuce, and layer it on top of your Ranch mixture. I chopped up the lettuce pretty small, in order to make it easier to eat. Anytime I order a salad at a restaurant, it always bugs me when they give me giant pieces of lettuce that I can't even fit in my mouth. So same principle applies here. Nice and small pieces of lettuce will be much easier to eat.

Finally, layer the rest of your toppings. After the lettuce, add the diced tomato, corn, cheddar cheese, bacon bits, and bleu cheese. For the corn, I like to use the fire roasted frozen corn that I find at Whole Foods. You can see it in the picture of all the needed ingredients above. I used this corn, put it in a glass bowl with a little water, and microwaved it so that it was no longer frozen. However, any corn you want to use is fine. If you're feeling ambitious, you can grill some corn. Or, if you're in a hurry, or can't find the fire roasted corn, you can buy any other frozen corn.

Once all your layers are added, you're ready to eat! I like to serve this dip with tortilla chips. But I'm sure it would be delicious with crackers or other chips as well.
