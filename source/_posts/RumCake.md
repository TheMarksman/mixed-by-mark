It is perfect for almost any occasion, and is easy to make. 

My mom made rum cake a lot when I was growing up, and it became one of our staples for our Christmas baking. This recipe in particular is very easy to make, because it uses a cake mix and instant pudding mix. 

You start with a Golden Butter cake mix and a package of instant vanilla pudding. The Golden Butter cake mix is preferred, but recently I've had trouble finding it in the grocery store. So if you can't find a butter cake mix, you can use an ordinary yellow cake mix. Combine the cake mix and pudding mix in a bowl. 

Then, mix in the eggs, rum, oil, and water until they are well combined. I have always used coconut rum for this recipe. It is my favorite, and I love the way it makes the cake taste. But, if you don't have coconut rum, or if you prefer something else, you can add any rum you choose. 

Make sure your cake pans are greased heavily, so that the cake does not stick. Pour your cake mix into your prepared pans. My mom always added chopped pecans after pouring in the batter. So you can do that if you wish. I never add the pecans. I have one friend who can't eat them, and I know nut allergies are very common. Plus, I never cared for the nuts on the cake. 

Then, you need to bake. If you're making one large bundt cake, bake for 1 hour at 325°F. If you're making mini bundts, bake for 15 minutes, also at 325°F.

Next, make the glaze. Combine the butter, sugar, water, and rum in a sauce pan. Heat this over medium heat, stirring continually until the sugar is dissolved and all ingredients are incorporated. Allow the glaze to boil for 2 minutes. Finally, poke holes in your cake and pour the glaze over the warm cake.
