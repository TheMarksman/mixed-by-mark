I love sliders. Who wouldn't love mini sandwiches? Especially when the recipe includes a full bottle of Guinness? 

These sliders went over very well with Tommy's coworkers. Everyone loved them, even though the ones I made didn't look nearly as appetizing as I had hoped they would. This is because I left them in the oven too long, and the tops looked pretty burned. Still tasted great, and they were still a hit. But next time I'll make sure to take them out of the oven sooner.

The sliders were easy to make, but they were a little tedious and took some time. 
Start by preheating the oven to 350°F. 
In a medium pan, melt one tablespoon of butter. Add in the mushrooms, onions, and 3 ounces of Guinness. Heat for 5-7 minutes, until the liquid is mostly absorbed.

Next, make the glaze. Combine the remaining 9 ounces of Guinness, butter, brown sugar, onion powder, parsley, and garlic in a medium pan. Bring the mixture to a boil, then reduce the heat and simmer until the mixture is thickened and reduced by about half. Set this aside until ready to use.

Slice the rolls in half, and place the bottom half in a 9x13-inch dish. Spread the dijon mustard on the bottom half of rolls.

Top the rolls with roast beef and the mushrooms and onions.

The place the slices of Swiss and cheddar cheese on top of the mushroom/onion mixture.

Finally, place the top half of the rolls on top of the cheese to complete your sandwich. Pour the set-aside glaze over the sandwiches. You may not use the entire glaze.

Bake the sliders, uncovered, for about 15 minutes, until they are heated through. 
Make sure to check them periodically to make sure the tops are not starting to burn. They can darken pretty quickly. 
After they are heated through, remove from the oven and serve warm.
