These Skeleton cakes are a delicious, more professional looking dessert for your Halloween festivities.

For our Halloween party, I decided I also wanted to make some cakes. The cakes were more a test of my decorating abilities than my actual baking.

I had found this skeleton cake pan at a store and thought it would be fun to try.

Because I mostly just wanted to test out my decorating abilities, and because I had already baked a ton of other things, I decided to just go with boxed cake mixes. I made one yellow cake and one chocolate cake. 

For the yellow cake, I decided to use chocolate frosting, and for the chocolate cake, I used white frosting. 

Once the cakes are baked and fully cooled, add both frostings to piping bags with star tips. 
To decorate these cakes, I just piped the starts all over the cake, making sure to lift up upon release, so that you end up with a good shape to your frosting. 

th one color frosting. Then fill in the remaining surface of the cake with the other type of frosting.
