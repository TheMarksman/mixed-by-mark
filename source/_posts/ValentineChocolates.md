These Valentine Chocolates are super easy to make. And you can add whatever fillings you want!

Elayne and I were at Walmart the other day, and I saw silicone molds in the shapes of hearts and roses. The roses really caught my eye. They were only a few dollars, so I just couldn't resist buying them so that I could make some chocolates with them. And I figured Valentine's Day was the perfect time for them. 

Making these chocolates is very similar to the Halloween {% post_link ChocolatePBSkulls Chocolate Peanut Butter Skulls %} and the Christmas {% post_link ChocolatePresents Chocolate Presents %}.

You will need: 
<ul class="post-body;">
    <li><b>Melting chocolate</b> - I chose to use milk chocolate and white chocolate, but you can use any combination you'd like.</li>
    <li><b>Candies or cookies for filling</b> - I used Heath Toffee bits, but you can be creative and use whatever you'd like. Some examples include crushed Oreos, M&M's, peanut butter, walnuts, etc.</li>
    <li><b>Silicone molds</b></li>
    <li><b>Sprinkles</b> - Optional, but can be fun if you have molds that are less intricate, like the hearts</li>
</ul>

Start by putting the sprinkles in the bottom of the molds, if you're planning to use them. I didn't want to cover up the detail of the rose mold, so I chose to only use sprinkles on the hearts. I used some red and gold sugar sprinkles, but you can use any you'd like.

Next, melt your chocolates. I poured them into a bowl and placed them in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time, until it is completely melted and smooth. Stir the chocolate well between each heating. Once your chocolate are melted, fill each mold about halfway full.

Add whatever fillings you would like to use. I chose Heath Toffee bits, mostly because I love toffee, and I already had some in my pantry. But you can choose any filling you'd like. Or have fun with it and use multiple! Try out a few things and see what works best. 
Once your fillings are in, add more chocolate, filling the mold all the way up.

Now you need to let the chocolate harden. You can let it sit at room temperature for a while, and it will harden on its own. Or, if you want to speed up the process, place the molds in the freezer for a few minutes. The chocolates will harden very quickly. 
After the chocolates are hardened, they are ready to be enjoyed! If you froze them, I recommend letting them come to room temperature before eating.
