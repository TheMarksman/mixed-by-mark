We didn't do much to celebrate today. 
Normally, we would get together with my family, hang out, eat some yummy food, and (at least before Elayne was born) watch some fireworks. 

This year was a little different. My mom has Covid right now. So we didn't get together with them. Instead, we went out to breakfast as a family. Our initial plan had been to get breakfast and then go checkout a new park and playground for Elayne. But then it started raining. So the park portion of our plan was canceled. 

Other than breakfast, we played with Elayne and tried to finish getting our house all settled.
Yes, we are still working on the house. We've only been in this new house a couple months, and we have so much we want to do. And it's a bigger house, so we're buying more furniture, more rugs, artwork, etc. So it has been a slow process. But I am determined to get it looking mostly done because we are having friends over this coming weekend.

Anyways, even though we didn't have major plans for today, and we weren't getting together with anyone, I decided I still wanted to do some festive baking. So Elayne and I made a {% post_link BerryIceboxCake Berry Icebox Cake %}.
