I'm a big fan of all chocolate: milk chocolate, white chocolate, dark chocolate. I'll take it all. 
And these Dark Chocolate Cupcakes are rich, decadent, and completely delicious.

I make these a couple weeks ago, when we celebrated my dad's birthday. He specifically wanted dark chocolate cupcakes with a fluffy white frosting. So that's what I made for him. 
Everyone loved them. Dark chocolate is not as sweet as milk chocolate or white chocolate, but these cupcakes are still sweet enough, especially when paired with a yummy sweet frosting. 

These cupcakes also include coffee, which helps to bring out the chocolate flavor even more. And having pieces of dark chocolate inside the cupcakes as well just adds even more deliciousness.

Start by preheating the oven to 350Â°F. Line 2 muffin pans with cupcake liners. Set these pans aside until ready to use. 

In the bowl of a stand mixer, whisk together the flour, brown sugar, sugar, cocoa powder, baking soda, and salt. I had my helper with me again. Elayne really enjoyed measuring out all the ingredients are for me... and eating a bunch of chocolate chips too ðŸ˜„

Next, add in the melted butter and the oil. Mix well. 
Then mix in the 2 eggs and 1 egg yolk, one at a time, mixing well between each addition. Make sure to scrape down the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed.

Mix in the vanilla. Then slowly add the buttermilk, mixing well while adding it. 
Roughly chop the dark chocolate chips. Then mix them into the batter.

Divide the batter evenly between the prepared cupcake liners. Only fill them about â…” of the way full. This will prevent the cupcakes from overflowing over the top when baking.

Bake the cupcakes for 15-18 minutes, until you can insert a toothpick in the middle and have it come out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool completely.

Once the cupcakes are fully cooled, you can frost them with any frosting you choose. For simplicity, I just bought a couple cans of white frosting from the grocery store and used that. But, I put the frosting in my stand mixer with the whisk attachment and whisked it for a few minutes. This allowed the frosting to get extra fluffy and not as thick. This is also a good tip if you're not sure you have enough icing and you're trying to stretch it a little.
