I know it's not quite fall yet, but I'm already getting excited for it. I made these cookies because we went over to a friend's house to watch the first Georgia Tech football game of the season. Although Tech lost, everyone loved the cookies. They have a very soft texture, almost like bread. And they are topped with a maple glaze that just brings the cookie to the next level.

Start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray.

<div style="display:flex;">
In a medium mixing bowl, mix together the flour, old-fashioned oats, cinnamon, baking soda, cloves, and salt. Set aside.

<div style="display:flex;">
In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter and brown sugar, until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add in the egg and vanilla, and mix again until all ingredients are well-combined.

<div style="display:flex;">
Gradually add the set-aside flour mixture into the butter/sugar mixture. Mix between each addition of flour. It's best to add the flour and other dry ingredients slowly because if you add it all in at once and attempt to mix, flour will fly everywhere. It makes a huge mess.

Next, peel and finely chop the apple. You want the pieces to be pretty small. If they are too big, or if there is too much apple, the cookie dough will not hold together very well. Sprinkle the lemon juice over the apple pieces, and toss to coat. Pour the apple pieces into the cookie dough, and stir to combine.

Scoop the cookie dough onto the prepared baking sheet. Bake for 12-14 minutes, until the cookies start to turn golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for a few minutes. Then remove from the pan and allow to cool completely.

Next, make the glaze. In a small bowl, combine the powdered sugar, milk, and syrup. Whisk until the ingredients are combined and the mixture is smooth. Drizzle the glaze over the cooled cookies. Allow the glaze to set before serving or stacking the cookies.
