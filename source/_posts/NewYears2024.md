Happy New Year!! ðŸ˜„ 
I know I'm a couple days late, but hey, life is busy.

We are all still recovering from being sick over Christmas. Elayne and I are mostly better, but Tommy still doesn't feel great. So because of this, and because we value our sleep (and Elayne's sleep schedule), we did not stay up til midnight to welcome the near year. Honestly, we haven't stayed up on New Year's Eve since 2018 or 2019. We've always kinda figured, if we don't have plans, what's the point? I'm sure we'll stay up in the future when Elayne is old enough to understand and wants to celebrate with us.

Anyways, we had a low-key New Year's Eve. And then on New Year's Day, as is my tradition, I took down all the Christmas decorations. I figure new year, new start. Elayne helped me with the decorations. She helped take the ornaments off the tree, and she carried some of the decorations to the dining room for me so that I could pack them up. But mostly, she sat at the table looking at the holiday cards while I put things away.

I know it's clichÃ©, but I'm determined to be healthier this year. I'm trying to eat better and workout more. My sister and I are meeting at a gym between our houses a few mornings a week to workout before she goes to work. And I'm cooking healthier meals and eating out less. 
But don't worry, although I'll be trying to cut down on my sugar, I'll still be baking and trying new recipes. ðŸ˜Š
