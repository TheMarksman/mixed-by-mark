It is very easy to throw together at the last minute, without needing any preparation beforehand. You can use the phyllo cups straight from the freezer - they don't need to be thawed since you are going to be putting them in the oven. Also, I used a pre-made spinach artichoke dip from the grocery store, for simplicity since I was making a lot of food for our party. But if you're feeling adventurous, you can make your own. Or, you could try another type of dip. Buffalo chicken dip maybe? 

I don't have any pictures of the process of making these, because I was scrambling trying to get them done as people were arriving for our housewarming party last weekend. This is an appetizer that is best served warm, so I recommend making it last-minute before guests arrive. Of course, having these last-minute appetizers can also be the most stressful for a hostess, no matter how simple they are. Because it always happens that you're trying to get all the last-minute things done at once. Finish the final appetizers, put out the drinks on ice, make sure the kitchen is cleaned up, etc. The last 30 minutes before a party are the most stressful, no matter how well you prepared beforehand. 

Anyways, they were still very easy. I actually asked some friends to help me make them, because I was running around like crazy. 

Start by preheating your oven to 375Â°F. Place the phyllo cups on an ungreased baking sheet. Place a small spoonful of spinach artichoke dip into each phyllo cup. Top the dip with a sprinkle of parmesan cheese and panko breadcrumbs. 

Bake for 12-16 minutes, until the cheese is melted and the breadcrumbs are toasted. That's it - you're done! Serve them warm and let your guests enjoy ðŸ˜Š
