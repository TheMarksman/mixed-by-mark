My mom used to make this recipe when I was growing up. It was so easy to make, and we all loved it, so it quickly became a family favorite. 

It can be a little messy once it is split open, and it's not quite as classy as bite-sized foods. So I usually make this for very casual get-togethers, as opposed to nicer parties. So I made this for our game night the other week. 

<div style="display:flex;">
It is very quick and simple to make, and you don't need many ingredients.

Start by making sure your puff pastry is thawed. You'll find the puff pastry in the frozen section of your grocery store. Make sure you get the one that says "sheets". There is another type that are cups. I made the mistake of accidently picking up the wrong one once. And then I had to ask a friend to stop by the store on her way over! 

<div style="display:flex;">
Preheat your oven to 350°F. Place the thawed puff pastry into a pie plate. I highly recommend using a pie plate or another dish with sides. If your pastry is not sealed well enough and cheese seeps out, it could be a mess if it runs off the pan. Spread a thin layer of apricot preserves on top.

Next, use a small knife to cut away asa much of the rind as possible from the brie. It doesn't need to be perfect. If there is some rind left over, it's not a big deal. The entire thing is edible. I just like to cut away the majority of the rind so that you only taste the brie.

Place the brie in the center of the pastry. Top it with more apricot preserves and some sliced almonds.

Next, fold up the corners of the pastry and seal it around the brie. It is important that it is sealed well so that the cheese does not seep out. Top the puff pastry with more apricot preserves and more sliced almonds.

Finally, bake the brie for 15-20 minutes, until the puff pastry is golden brown. Serve your brie with crackers. My favorite to use is Wheat Thins, but any crackers will work well.
