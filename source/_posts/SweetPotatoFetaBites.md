Whenever I am making food for a party or get-together of any kind, I try to have a good variety of foods available. So this means I have some sweet, some savory. I have some with meat, some vegetarian. And I have some heavier, some lighter. 

These Sweet Potato Feta Bites are the perfect light appetizer. They are easy to make, and they are just so satisfying to eat. Maybe I'm a little biased because I just love sweet potatoes in practically any form, but I thought they were absolutely delicious! 

Start by preheating your oven to 450°F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. 
Then peel and slice your sweet potatoes into ½-inch rounds. The sweet potatoes I found at the store were <i>massive</i>, so I decided to cut some of the sweet potato rounds into halves, or even quarters for the really big ones.

Place the sweet potato rounds onto the prepared baking sheet, with the scooped-out well facing up. Brush the tops of the sweet potatoes with olive oil, and sprinkle Italian seasoning on them. Bake them for about 25 minutes, until the edges are just starting to brown.

While the sweet potatoes are baking, mash together the feta cheese, sour cream, Greek seasoning, and scallions in a medium bowl. I found Greek seasoning at my local grocery store in the section with all the other spices. If you're having trouble finding some, it may be with the spices or in the international aisle.

When the sweet potatoes are finished baking, remove them from the oven. Place a small spoonful of the feta mixture into the well of each sweet potato. Place the baking sheet back in the oven for another 5 minutes, or until the cheese is starting to melt.

Serve the bites immediately when they are finished baking so that they will still be hot. 

If you are making these bites for a party, I know how crucial it can be to prep as much as possible ahead of time. So luckily, this appetizer can be prepped early too. If you're making them ahead of time, you can scoop out the center of the sweet potatoes and bake them. Then add the feta mixture on top of the potatoes and place them in the fridge until closer to your party. Before baking them again, bring the pan out of the fridge and all the potatoes to come to room temperature. Then bake for the remaining 5 minutes to melt the cheese.
