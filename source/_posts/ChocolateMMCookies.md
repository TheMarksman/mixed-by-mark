They are a crowd-pleasing treat for anyone who loves chocolate. They are rich and yummy. And they can be enjoyed by both kids and adults. They do contain peanut butter, so just be aware if there are any allergies before serving. 

This is another of the treats I made for the baby shower last weekend. They were a big hit! On the label for them, I did make sure to mention that they contain peanut butter, just in case. There were a lot of people I didn't know at the shower, so I wasn't sure if anyone had any problems with peanuts. Always better to be safe.

What I like about these cookies is that they are easy to make. And the recipe makes a lot of cookies, so they are an easy treat for a party. So where do we start?

In a medium bowl, combine the flour, cocoa powder, baking soda, salt, and pudding mix. Set this aside until ready to use.

Next, in the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter, peanut butter, sugar, and brown sugar. The mixture should be fully combined and creamy. Then add in the eggs and vanilla. Mix until all ingredients are fully incorporated.

Now it's time to add in the flour mixture that you set aside. Gradually add the flour mixture into the butter mixture. Mix to combine between each addition of flour. This prevents flour from flying everywhere when the mixer is turned on. The dough will be very thick - this is ok. Then stir in the chocolate chips and M&M's.

<div style="display:flex;">
Place the cookie dough in the fridge to chill for about 30 minutes. 
When finished chilling, preheat the oven to 350°F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. 
Scoop the dough into 1-inch balls, and place them on the prepared baking sheet. Flatten them slightly with the palm of your hand.

Bake the cookies for 8 minutes, until the edges begin to look slightly dried. Allow the cookies to cool slightly on the pan before removing to cool completely.
