Despite my love of peanut butter, I have never been a big fan on the traditional peanut butter cookie. I'm not entirely sure why. But when I eat them, I always crave something more, an additional texture or flavor. 

But these Peanut Butter Monster Cookies have everything I want. The Reese's Pieces and peanut butter chips add a creaminess, and the oats help to make the cookies satisfying and more filling. 

They are full of a rich peanut butter flavor, are very easy to make, and loved by all who eat them (assuming they like peanut butter ðŸ˜‹). 

The cookies are easy to make. 
In a large bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the butter, brown sugar, and peanut butter until it is light and fluffy. Then, mix in the eggs and vanilla until well combined. 

Finally, stir in the flour, baking soda, cornstarch, baking powder, salt, and oats. Stir until everything is combined. Stir in the peanut butter chips and Reese's Pieces.

Roll the dough into balls and place them on a greased baking sheet. Gently press down on the dough to form a thick cookie shape. Bake for 10-12 minutes, until the edges of the cookie are just set. Remove the cookies from the oven and allow them to cool for a couple minutes before removing from the pan.
