I made these for our game night over the weekend, and by the end, there were none left. I consider pizza a comfort food. And having them in bite-sized pieces is even better. Yes, I realize that you can just buy pizza rolls in the frozen section of your grocery store. But I really like this recipe because they are less greasy than the frozen pizza rolls. And they are very easy to make.

<div style="display:flex;">
You start by rolling out the pizza dough. I like to use the canned refrigerated pizza dough. It is very easy to roll out, and it's already rectangular, so it's easy to cut into squares. You'll need 2 cans. Can each can into 24 squares.

Chop the block of cheese into 48 cubes. And then roughly chop the pepperoni into small pieces. I usually cut the circles of pepperoni into fourths. Place a cube of cheese and a few pepperoni pieces onto each square of pizza dough.

Then seal up each pizza dough square. Make sure it is sealed well so that cheese does not spill out when it is baked. Then place the pizza bite in a greased baking dish. I find it best to place the side with the sealed seam down. This helps to keep the filling from spilling out.

Next, mix together the olive oil and Italian seasoning. If you don't have Italian seasoning, you can use a combination of oregano, basil, parsley, and garlic powder. Then, brush the mixture over the pizza bites. Sprinkle parmesan cheese over all the bites.

<div style="display:flex;">
Bake the pizza bites for 16-20 minutes at 400°F. They are done when they are a golden brown color. Remove them from the oven, and serve them with pizza sauce for dipping.
