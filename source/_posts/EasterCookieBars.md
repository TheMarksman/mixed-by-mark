These cookie bars are just like normal chocolate chip cookie bars, except they include mini chocolate candy eggs, which can be found just about anywhere leading up to Easter!

They are deliciously sweet, and fun to make. Let the kids help with the baking; they'll love it. Elayne really liked helping me...and eating candy eggs and chocolate chips! ðŸ˜„ 

Start by preheating the oven to 375Â°F. Grease a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray; set this aside until ready to use.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, salt, and cornstarch til they are fully combined. Set this aside until ready to use.

Next, in a large bowl, cream together the melted butter, sugar, and brown sugar until fully combined and smooth. Add in the egg and vanilla. Mix again until all ingredients are incorporated.

Gradually add in the flour mixture, mixing well between each addition. Make sure to scrape down the sides of the bowl as needed. Once the flour is fully mixed in, add in 1Â½ cups of the mini eggs and the chocolate chips. Some of the eggs will probably break apart some. This is ok and expected.

Press the dough into the prepared 9x13" pan. Take the remaining Â½ cup of mini eggs and press them into the top of the dough for decoration. Bake the cookie bars for 13-15 minutes, til the edges just begin to turn golden-brown.

Allow the cookie bars to cool fully before slicing and serving.
