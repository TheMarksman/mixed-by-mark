Last night, we had some of Tommy's coworkers over to hang out and play games. So, of course, I spent way too much time planning and cooking, and made way too much food, as per my usual ðŸ˜Š 

I had never met any of Tommy's coworkers, and so I really wanted to make a good impression. I think I did pretty well. Everyone raved over the food, which made me feel really good. 

When I make food for parties, I always try to have a good variety of foods. I have some lighter foods and some heavier, more filling foods. This Chicken Avocado Crescent Ring fell into the more filling category. 

<div style="display:flex;">
It was pretty easy to make, and there was very little left over at the end of the night, so I think it was enjoyed. Start by preheating the oven to 375Â°F. Line a baking sheet with parchment paper. If you don't have parchment paper, you could grease the baking sheet. But for something like this, I think parchment paper works better. When greasing a pan, it's easy to miss a spot and have your food stick. And you really don't want your crescent ring to stick to the pan and break while trying to put it on a serving tray.

Place an oven-safe bowl in the middle of the baking sheet. Unroll the crescent roll dough, placing the triangles to overlap each other w/ the bowl in the center. When I made this, I placed the bowl upside-down. Turns out, this was a mistake. It was very difficult to remove the bowl from the middle without breaking the ring after it was done baking. I did manage it, but it could have been much easier. So next time, I'll be placing the bowl upright.

Sprinkle half of the shredded cheese around the base of the ring. Place the diced chicken and avocado over the cheese. Then, sprinkle the remaining cheese and bacon over the top of the chicken and avocado.

Roll the narrow end of each triangle over, tucking the end underneath. This will help to seal the dough so that the ring does not fall apart when being transferred to a serving platter. 
In a small bowl, beat the egg. Brush the egg over the top of the ring. Sprinkle with sea salt.

Bake for 15-20 minutes, until the crescent ring turns golden brown. 
While it's baking, prepare the dipping sauce by combining the ranch, basil, garlic powder, and minced onion in a small bowl. Mix until the ingredients are well-combined. 
When the ring is finished baking, allow it to cool for a couple minutes on the pan. Then transfer it to a serving platter, and place the dipping sauce in a bowl in the middle.
