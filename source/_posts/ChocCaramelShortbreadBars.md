I have recently grown to love shortbread, especially when paired with something extra sweet like caramel or chocolate.

These Chocolate Caramel Shortbread Bars are rich and indulgent. They are the perfect treat. The shortbread prevents the caramel and chocolate from being too sickeningly sweet, and provides the perfect crumbly texture. 

<div style="display:flex;">
They are easy to make, and they don't require too many ingredients. I did have to run to the grocery store to buy some caramels and heavy cream, because these are ingredients I don't usually keep around the house.

Start by preheating your oven to 350Â°F, and grease a 9x13 inch with cooking spray. 
In the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the butter, powdered sugar, sugar, and vanilla. Beat until these ingredients are all well combined.

I had my little helper working with me today. And by "help", I mean that she ate a bunch of the chocolate chips and almost spilled all the flour on the floor ðŸ˜‚ 
But she loves to try to help, and she is fascinated by watching the mixer. When she gets a little older, I'm hoping we'll actually be able to bake together. Ever since I decided I wanted to have kids of my own, I have looked forward to baking cookies and other treats with them. I want to share my passion with them, and I hope they'll enjoy it too.

Ok, back to the shortbread: Next, gradually add in the flour, mixing between each addition. It is important to do this slowly - if you try to add all the flour at once, it will go everywhere when you turn on the mixer! Trust me, I've made this mistake more than once. 
Once all the flour is in, mix until it is just incorporated. The shortbread dough will be crumbly. This is expected. It should hold form when it is pressed together.

Press about half of the shortbread dough into the bottom of the prepared 9x13 inch pan. Bake this base for 25 minutes, until the dough is golden.

While the shortbread base is baking, add the caramels and heavy cream in a pan on the stove. Heat on medium-low heat, stirring frequently, until the caramel is fully melted and the mixture is smooth.

Pour the melted caramel over the shortbread base. Make sure to spread it all the way to the edges. Then, sprinkle the chocolate chips over the caramel layer.

Finally, take small handfuls of the remaining shortbread dough. Press each handful between your palms to flatten it. Place the flattened piece of dough on top of the chocolate layer. Repeat until all the remaining dough is used, making sure to cover as much of the chocolate layer with dough as possible.

Bake the shortbread bars for 30-35 minutes, until the top is a nice golden brown color. Remove from the oven, and allow the shortbread to cool completely before cutting and serving.
