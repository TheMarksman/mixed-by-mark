If I'm being perfectly honest, peanut butter cookies were never my favorite. I mean, don't get me wrong, if they're in front of me, I'll eat them and even enjoy them. But they were never my go-to choice for a cookie to make. But adding Nutella to peanut butter cookies can only make them better!

These cookies are very easy to make. Start by preheating your oven to 350°F, and grease a baking sheet. 
With an electric mixer, cream together the softened butter, sugar, and brown sugar until they are light and fluffy. Then add in the vanilla, eggs, and peanut butter. Mix again until it's all fully combined.

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add the flour mixture to the wet ingredients, mixing between each addition. Finally, once all the flour mixture is in, add the Nutella and mix until just incorporated. Try not to overmix this. The cookie dough will be very thick, but that's ok.

Scoop the dough into 1-inch balls on your greased baking sheet.

Bake the cookies for 10-12 minutes. They will look underdone, but will firm up some as they cool. Allow the cookies to cool for a couple minutes before removing them from the pan to cool completely.
