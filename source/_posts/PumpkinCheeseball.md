This is the kind of food that's perfect for a party. It's easy to make, doesn't require a ton of ingredients, and can be made ahead of time.

I made this cheeseball for our Halloween party over the weekend, and everyone loved it! Plus, it has red pepper and scallions in it, so it counts as eating your vegetables, right?! ðŸ˜Š

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by mixing together the regular cream cheese and vegetable cream cheese. I like to use a hand mixer for this, but you could also use a stand mixer. Of, if you're feeling like getting a good arm workout, you could stir it by hand.

Then slice up the scallions, and finely dice the red pepper. Make sure to save the red pepper stem to be used when serving. I usually put it in a ziploc bag and place it in the fridge. To the cream cheeses, mix in the Ranch seasoning, scallions, red pepper, and one cup of sharp cheddar cheese.

Spread out a large sheet of saran wrap. In the middle of it, spread out about Â¼ cup of the remaining cheddar cheese. Then place the cheeseball mixture on top.

Sprinkle the remaining shredded cheese around the top and sides of the cheeseball. Wrap up the cheeseball tightly in saran wrap. I recommend wrapping it in a double layer.

Then wrap 4 large rubber bands around the cheeseball. Place it in the fridge for at least 2 hours, but I recommend leaving it in there overnight. When you're ready to serve, remove the rubber bands and saran wrap. Place the red pepper stem on top. Serve with some crackers (my favorite are wheat thins), and you're done!
