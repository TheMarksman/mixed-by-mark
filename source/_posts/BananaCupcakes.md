I made this recipe during 2020. We were desperate to see people, tired of being cooped up in the house. So we had a couple friends over for a socially distant, outdoor hangout. We pulled the tv into the garage and set up some chairs (6 feet apart). And we watched a Georgia Tech football game. 

This recipe is a little more time consuming, since in addition to making the cupcakes, you also have to make two difference frostings. But we weren't going out anywhere, and we had no real plans during 2020, so I had a lot of free time on my hands. And I needed to find some fun things to occupy my time so that I didn't go crazy or get depressed. Because let's be real, I was already a little depressed not being able to see many people, or hug my family when we hung out with them outdoors. Not a fun time. 

But back to the cupcakes. 
We start by making the cupcakes. First, preheat the oven to 350Â°F, and line your muffin pan with cupcake liners. 

To make the cupcake batter, beat the softened butter, brown sugar, and sugar together until creamy. Add in the eggs and mix again. Then, add the mashed bananas and vanilla, and mix until all ingredients are combined. 

In a separate bowl, mix together the flour, baking soda, cinnamon, and salt. Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, mixing between each addition. Then add in the buttermilk and mix until all ingredients are combined. Finally, fold in the chocolate chips. 

Evenly distribute the batter into the cupcakes liners, filling them about â…” full. Bake for 17-19 minutes, until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Allow the cupcakes to cool fully before adding the frosting. 

Now, we need to make the frostings. Let's start with the chocolate one. Beat the softened butter until it's creamy. In a separate bowl, sift together the powdered sugar and cocoa powder. Slowly add the powdered sugar/cocoa mixture, heavy cream, and vanilla to the butter. Mix between each addition. Beat the frosting on high speed until fully combined and creamy. Set the chocolate frosting aside while we make the peanut butter frosting.

For the peanut butter frosting, mix together the peanut butter and softened butter until it's creamy. Then mix in the powdered sugar and vanilla. Finally, add the heavy cream, and mix on high until the frosting is creamy. 

Once the cupcakes are fully cooled, we can swirl the frosting on top. In order to get the frosting to swirl together, I place both frostings into a single pastry bag. To make this process easier, place the pastry bag into a large cup so that the pastry bag will stay open while you spoon in the frosting. Then spoon the chocolate frosting into one side of the pastry bag, and spoon the other peanut butter frosting into the other side. Now, when you squeeze the frosting out, you will get a nice swirl of chocolate and peanut butter ðŸ˜Š
