I figured these cookies worked really well for Easter because they are so colorful. But the great thing about these cookies is that you can make them for any occasion. Christmas cookies? Use red and green sprinkles. Halloween cookies? Orange sprinkles. Everyday cookies? Any color sprinkles, or even just plain sugar.

To make these, I used my typical {% post_link SugarCookies Sugar Cookies %} recipe.

There are only a couple of differences. Instead of rolling the cookie dough in regular sugar, roll it in colorful sugar sprinkles.

Bake the cookies at 350Â°F for 15 minutes. After removing from the oven, allow the cookies to cool slightly for just a minute. Then press a Hershey's Kiss on each cookie. Allow the cookies to cool completely.
