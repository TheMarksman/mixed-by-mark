Every baker needs her tools!

While it is not strictly necessary to have every piece of baking equipment, there are some essentials that I truly believe are game-changers for baking. Below I've listed some of the basic equipment you will want. But let's be real, there are sooo many baking appliances, gadgets, and devices now. There are specialty pans to make specific cakes, or to create different shapes. I already have more baking pans than I need. But occasionally it's fun to make those specialty items that are not my normal go-to baked goods. If I want to make a cheesecake, my springform pans are a must. I also have mini springform pans large bundt pans, mini bundt pans, doughnut pans, loaf pans, mini muffin pans, etc. You get the picture. It's very easy to accumulate a lot of baking equipment.

    <li>Stand Mixer
        <ul>
            <li>I personally <b><i>love</i></b> my KitchenAid mixer! To me, having an electric stand mixer is just so crucial for baking. It allows me to prep other ingredients while my mixer runs, and I don't have to stand there holding up a handheld mixer. I also love that it comes with different attachments: the paddle attachment, whisk, and dough hook. There are also other brands of stand mixers, but KithenAid is my favorite. Mine has lasted me for several years, no issue. And my mom has had hers for as long as I can remember without any issues.</li>

    <li>Measuring cups & spoons</li>
    <li>Liquid measuring cup
        <ul>
            <li>It is important to note that fluid ounces differ from solid ounces. This is why it is always important to measure your wet ingredients using a liquid measuring cup.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Spatulas
        <ul>
            <li>I highly recommend getting some silicone <b><i>heat resistant</b></i> spatulas. I use mine for everything! I love the silicone because they are so versitile. I use them for all of my baking and cooking. Nothing sticks to them, and they also will not scratch my good pans. You definitely want the heat resistant ones though, so that it doesn't melt while you're stirring something on the stove!</li>
            <li>I also like to get the spatulas that are fully silicone, instead of the ones that have a plastic handle and silicone head. I find that the latter tend to break more easily. Also, they don't get as clean, because food inevitably gets stuck in the space between the plastic and silicone.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
    <li>Cookie sheets</li>
    <li>Cake pans</li>
    <li>Cupcake/Muffin pan</li>
    <li>Mixing bowls</li>
    <li>Pastry bags & decorating tips
        <ul>
            <li>These are not strictly necessary, but they are fun to have if you want to make your baked goods look even more presentable. If you don't have pastry bags and tips, you can always use a Ziploc bag with a corner cut off.</li>
        </ul>
