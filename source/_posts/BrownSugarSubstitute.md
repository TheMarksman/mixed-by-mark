No brown sugar? Or just not enough? 
I've run into this problem many times. I decide I just want to make one more batch of cookies, but my brown sugar container is mostly empty. So now what? 

Well, good news: You can make your own brown sugar at home! 
All you need is white granulated sugar and molasses. 

I don't have exact amounts for you for this substitute. Start with your white sugar in a bowl, and mix in small amounts of molasses until your sugar reaches the color you desire. 

When I use brown sugar, I typically buy light brown sugar. But if a recipe specifically calls for dark brown sugar, I will use it. The reason I'm mentioning this is because there is a difference in the two. Dark brown sugar contains much more molasses than light brown sugar. 
So when you're mixing the white sugar and molasses, you will add less molasses if you want light brown sugar, and more molasses if you want dark brown sugar.
