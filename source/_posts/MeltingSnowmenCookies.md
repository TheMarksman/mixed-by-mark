My mom and I bake together every year. This year, my older sister was in town, and she joined us in our Christmas baking. 

In year's past, we have baked all day long, completely losing track of time throughout the day. This year was a little different because while we were baking, we were also keeping an eye on Elayne while she played with her toys. So we weren't able to be quite as productive as our typical Christmas baking. But that's ok. We like to make some treats to give to neighbors and close friends, but there is nothing specific that we need to bake. 

I always love finding a cute Christmas treat to make. This year, I chose to make Melting Snowmen Cookies. They turned out so adorable! They were a little tedious to make, like many of these type of treats are. But that's ok. This is the type of treat that you limit the amount you make. Trying to make too many batches of these would take a long time, because you have to decorate them in addition to baking. But they are fun to make! 

So how do we make these cute melting snowmen? 
Here's what you will need: 
<ul class="post-body">
    <li>Sugar cookies
        <ul><li>You can use premade cookies or make your own. I used my {% post_link SugarCookies Sugar Cookies %} recipe.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Big marshmallows</li>
    <li>Cookie icing
        <ul><li>I included a recipe below. Or you can use another recipe of your choice.</li></ul>
    </li>
    <li>Food coloring pens</li>
</ul>

<div style="display:flex;">
First, use the food coloring pens to draw a snowman's face on each marshmallow.

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, make your cookie icing using the recipe below or another recipe of your choice. Spread the icing on top of the sugar cookies. Place a marshmallow on top of each cookie. Allow the icing to set so that it is firm to the touch.

</div>
</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Once the icing is set, use the food coloring pens to draw the arms and buttons on the snowmen. I also included a colorful bowtie on each. When drawing on the icing, you may need to only press very very lightly. I think I put slightly too much icing on top of the cookies. And so the icing did not harden all the way through. So if I put too much pressure on the icing with the pen, then it pushed through to the soft icing underneath. So I would recommend only using very light pressure.

Once you let the food coloring dry for a couple minutes, you're done! You now have some adorable melted snowman cookies!
