Out of powdered sugar, but need it for your baking?! 

<!--more-->

I'm sure every baker has run into this problem at least once, me included. 
There have been several times where I wanted to make an additional batch of icing for a cake or cupcakes. But then I didn't have enough powdered sugar to make it. In my experience, I typically need more icing than a recipe calls for, and I forget to factor in the ingredients for an additional batch of icing when I'm doing my grocery shopping. 

But you're in luck. Making your own powdered sugar is easy. All you need is white granulated sugar, cornstarch, and a food processor! 

In a food processor, mix together 1 cup of white granulated sugar with 1 tablespoon of cornstarch. Mix until the sugar is the powdery consistency you're looking for. 

No food processor? Not a problem You could use a blender instead!
