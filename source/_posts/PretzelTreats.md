Just three simple ingredients: pretzels, Hershey's Hugs, and M&M's. These treats have the perfect combination of salty and sweet, and they are always a big hit.

I used to make these delicious treats in high school, and I was always getting requests for more. They are very easy to make, if not a little time consuming. Honestly, the worst part about making them is unwrapping all of the Hershey's Hugs. I find the most enjoyable way to do this is to plop down in front of the TV and unwrap them all ahead of time while watching one of my favorite shows. It definitely helps to kill the monotony. 

<div style="display: flex;">
To make Pretzel Treats, there are only a few simple steps. 
First, line a baking sheet with square pretzels. Using square pretzels is important, because this shape allows the least amount of chocolate to flow through the pretzel, resulting in fewer chocolatey messes and fewer pretzels stuck to the pan. I can usually find the square pretzels in the Snyders of Hanover brand, but any brand will work.

Next, we need to unwrap the Hershey's Hugs and place them on the center of the pretzel. Keeping the Hug as close to the center as possible will prevent the pretzels from sticking together as much. 

Then bake the pretzels for about 5 minutes at 150°F, or until the center of the Hug is soft. To test this, I take an M&M and press it into one of the Hugs in the middle of the pan. It if presses in easily, they are ready to come out of the oven. With Hugs, the white chocolate melts more quickly than the milk chocolate inside. So when you press the M&M in, it the outside may be very soft, but the inside is still too firm. This is why it's important to check before pulling the pan out of the oven. 

Immediately after taking the pan out of the oven, press an M&M into each Hug. This needs to be done before the chocolate cools too much. Then allow the chocolate to cool and harden. You can do this by allowing it to cool at room temperature, or by placing the baking pan in the refrigerator.

        <ol class="post-body">
            <li>If using Hershey's Kisses instead of Hugs, baking time will need to be slightly longer, as milk chocolate takes longer to melt than white chocolate.</li>
            <li>Using square pretzels prevents too much chocolate from flowing through the pretzel and sticking to the pan.</li>
