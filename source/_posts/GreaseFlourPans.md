When baking cakes, it is important to grease and flour your cake pans. This prevents your cakes from sticking or falling apart.

But some new bakers may wonder: How exactly does one go about greasing and flouring a cake pan? 
So here's how you do it. 

First, you need either some cooking spray or some vegetable oil. I prefer to use cooking spray, simply for convenience. So, spray the bottom and sides of your cake pan generously. Then, I like to take a paper towel and wipe it along the pan. The purpose of this is to make sure the oil gets evenly distributed over the pan without missing any spots. This also prevents having too much oil in the pan. 

If you don't have cooking spray, or prefer to use vegetable oil, simply pour a little oil on a paper towel and rub it along the bottom and sides of your pan, making sure to cover the entire area. 

Next, take a couple pinches of flour and drop them in the pan. Rotate the pan and tap the sides, letting the flour cover and stick to the entire pan. I find it best to do this over the sink, because a little flour typically spills out, especially when trying to coat the sides. If needed to adequately cover the pan, add some more flour, little bits at a time. 

Finally, once the entire pan is coated with flour, I like to flip the pan over and tap it on the counter. This helps to get rid of any excess flour or any clumps. 

Now you're ready to bake some cakes!!
