Merry Christmas!! 

<br>
<!--more-->

We had a relaxing, and also a somewhat atypical Christmas this year. 
On Christmas Eve, we had some friends over for brunch. Well, about 30 minutes before they arrived here that morning, our heat went out on our main floor and basement levels. Luckily, the upstairs remained alright. So Christmas Eve, Christmas Day, and for about 3 days after Christmas, we were running space heaters in our living room, with plastic sheeting covering the doorways to keep the heat in. And we walked around all bundled up. It wasn't ideal, but we were lucky that the upstairs heat was still working, so we were comfortable while sleeping at night. 

On Christmas Day, we started the day doing our Christmas traditions just the 3 of us. First, we had to get our pictures on the stairs. When I was growing up, my parents made me and my sisters sit at the top of the stairs and take a picture there before we were allowed to go downstairs and see what Santa brought. My sisters and I used to complain about this, claiming it was silly. But now, looking back at all the pictures, I have such good memories of me and my sisters sitting on those stairs, anxiously waiting to go downstairs and open presents. We used to sit up there laughing, waiting for our parents to take the picture and let us downstairs. So now I want to continue this tradition with my own family.

Then, after pictures on the stairs, we let Elayne open her presents at our house. 
And after that, we went to my parents' house to celebrate with the rest of the family. We had a lot of fun eating brunch, opening presents, and just spending time together.

Elayne had so many presents to open! I think she got a little overwhelmed, but she definitely enjoyed herself! The biggest hit was her own rocking chair. She immediately crawled up into it and started rocking. It was very cute. And she looked so proud of herself for getting it to rock back and forth.

I hope every else had a Christmas just as enjoyable as ours!
