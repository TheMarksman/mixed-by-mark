I made these for Easter, but you could really enjoy them for any spring-time treat. Or, many people make these in just a ball shape, as opposed to a nest, and then they can be enjoyed year-round. 

<div style="display:flex;">
They are very quick and easy to make. My only complaint about them is that they can be a little messy to eat, as they tend to melt in your fingers quickly. But some messy fingers never hurt anyone.

Start by greasing 2 standard-size muffin pans with cooking spray. This will prevent the nests from sticking to the pan, and will allow them to pop out easily. Next, pour the white chocolate chips into a microwavable bowl, and melt the chocolate until it's completely melted and smooth. To do this, I initially heated the chocolate for a minute, then stirred it, and put it back into the microwave for another 30 seconds. By the end of this time, my chocolate was melted.

Then, combine the melted white chocolate, peanut butter, and powdered sugar into a medium-sized bowl. Stir this mixture until all the ingredients are fully combined and the mixture is smooth.

Fold in the chow mein noodles and stir gently until all the noodles are well coated. If you've never tried chow mein noodles before, they really don't have much taste. They just give a satisfying crunch. 
When finished folding in the chow mein noodles, spoon the mixture into the greased muffin tins. Use a spoon to gently press down on the center to form a nest shape. Finally, place the egg candies on top of the nest. I used the Cadbury candy eggs, but you can use any egg-shaped candies you'd like.
