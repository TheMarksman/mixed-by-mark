I have been trying to eat healthier lately, so that means not eating as many sweets. But when a holiday comes around, you have to celebrate some, right? So I made this yummy dessert that I don't feel quite as bad about indulging in. 

<div style="display:flex;">
This is also super simple and quick to make. It only took about 15 minutes to whip it up (because I forgot to make it earlier in the day ðŸ«£). Elayne even helped me make it. She loves to help me measure out ingredients and pour them into the mixing bowl.

So where do we start? 
Using a mixer with a whisk attachment, beat the heavy cream, 1 Tbsp of sugar, and vanilla until peaks form. When finished, it should have the consistency of whipped cream. I chose to use my stand mixer, because I looove my stand mixer. But you could also use a hand mixer if that's easier for you. Set your whipped cream aside.

Next, using a food processor, mix together Â½ cup of sugar and the 2 cups of frozen raspberries. When finished mixing, all the raspberries should be broken up. But you will not end up with a smooth mixture; it'll have more of a consistency of sand. I had my little helper for this part. She was intrigued by the food processor, because it's not something I use often.

Once your raspberry mixture is ready, fold it into the whipped cream. I like to use a rubber spatula and gently run it around the edges and then into the middle. Of course, Elayne wanted to help with the stirring, her favorite baking task (other than eating ðŸ˜Š).

Divide the Raspberry Whip between 4 cups or glasses. For mine and Tommy's I used some pretty martini glasses. And then Elayne got hers in a small glass cup that was less likely to be toppled over or shattered. 
If you're not planning on eating your dessert immediately, place it in the fridge until ready to serve.
