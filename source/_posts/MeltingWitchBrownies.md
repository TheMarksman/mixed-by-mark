Tommy's work decided to have a potluck lunch for Halloween. And so Tommy asked me if I'd want to do some baking for it. Of course, I said yes! 

I wanted to make a really cute Halloween treat, so I decided on these Melting Witch Brownies. 
They are very easy to make and don't require many ingredients. 

Start by making a batch of brownies however you'd like. I decided to just use a boxed brownie mix. But, I placed some Hershey's bars with almonds in the middle of the batter before baking. It adds to the brownies, making them extra delicious, with a nice crunch from the almonds. 

Next, make the witch hats. You'll need Fudge Stripes cookies, Hershey's Kisses, and a little frosting, colored orange. Place the orange frosting in a piping bag with a small, round tip. Pipe a ring of orange frosting onto the back of a Fudge Stripes cookie, around the central hole. Then, place a Hershey's Kiss on top of the frosting.

Next, use green food coloring to make your green witch frosting. Place the tub of frosting in the microwave. Heat for 30 seconds at a time, stirring in between, until the frosting is fully melted and thin enough to drizzle off a spoon easily.

On top of each brownie, drizzle a spoonful of melted frosting. It doesn't have to cover the entire top of the brownie. I like to have the frosting just start to drip off some of the sides of the brownie. Then place a cookie/hug witch hat on top of the brownie.

Allow the brownies to sit out until the frosting has hardened enough so that it doesn't drip anymore. Then you can serve your delicious treats!
