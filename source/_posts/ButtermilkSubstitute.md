<div class="post-body">
Don't you just hate when a recipe calls for buttermilk? 
I know I do. This is because I don't use buttermilk for anything else. I don't make buttermilk pancakes from scratch (let's be real, I buy the "just add water" mix). I don't typically make biscuits from scratch. When else do you really need a lot of buttermilk? 

And most of the time, if a recipe calls for buttermilk, it's only a small amount, maybe a quarter cup. And then what do you do with the remaining 1Â¾ cups left in the carton?? 

Fear not. Instead of buying a bunch of buttermilk at the store that you won't end up using, make your own at home. 

Simply mix together 1 cup of regular milk with 1 tablespoon of lemon juice. 

Happy baking!
