I grew up making these Chocolate Pudding Cakes with my mom. They were a staple for our holiday baking. When I was younger, I didn't like them much, only because the glaze contained nuts, and I was determined that nuts ruined desserts. But they were continuously part of our traditional baking, and I eventually grew to love them. 

These cakes are rich and sweet, and with the glaze soaking through them, they are very moist. Heat it up a little in the microwave and eat it with some ice cream. You can't go wrong. 

Whenever I bake these cakes, I always use mini bundt pans and make individual cakes. This makes it easier to give for the holidays, and it also makes this a good party dessert. But you can also make a single larger cake using a tube pan. 

The recipe is simple. It involves a yellow cake mix and a package of instant chocolate pudding. Sounds delicious, right?
