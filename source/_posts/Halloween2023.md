Halloween is always such a fun time! Getting to dress up, pretend to be someone else, going to Halloween parties. And, of course, all the candy and sweet treats. As a kid, I always loved Halloween. And now, as a mom, I'm still loving it!

This year was Elayne's first time trick-or-treating. I wasn't sure how she would do with it. She can be very timid sometimes, not always very outgoing in new situations. But she absolutely loved it!!

Initially, Tommy and I had thought Elayne would only make it to a few houses before getting tired and being ready to go home. But she made it to about 15 homes! All of which had long driveways and stairs to climb. She was a champ! She loved ringing the doorbells and then of course picking out her candy. After every house, she would rush to Tommy to show him what new candy she had gotten. It was so cute!!

I don't think she's going to be happy when I start taking down the Halloween decorations. But there's always next year to look forward to!
