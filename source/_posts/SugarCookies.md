These cookies are simple, sweet, and addictive. They are loved by adults and children alike. You can eat them plain, or top them with frosting and sprinkles. 

I recently made these cookies for my neighborhood's Children's Fall Festival event. I made both chocolate chip and sugar cookies. I figured, these were safe options that kids would love. It seems I was right. I had so many compliments about the cookies, and I had several kids asking their parents if they could have more. Gotta say, that made me feel good. 

Like any sugar cookies, these are easy to make, and don't take too much time either. The most tedious part is rolling the dough in sugar.

No special ingredients are needed - just things you would find in most bakers' pantries.

In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking soda, and baking powder. Set this bowl aside for later. 
In a large bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the softened butter and sugar until the mixture is smooth. Then, add in the egg yolks and vanilla. Mix until it's combined. 
Slowly add in the flour mixture, mixing between each addition.

Scoop the dough into balls and roll into sugar. Place the dough on the greased baking sheet. Bake for 15-18 minutes at 350°F, until the tops of the cookies begin to crack. 
Let the cookies cool for a few minutes on the pan before removing them to cool fully.
