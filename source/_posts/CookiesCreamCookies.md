Who doesn't love a good Oreo? You get the sweet chocolate with the creamy center. These cookies have all that and more. They are very rich and indulgent, but they are so easy to make! 

This recipe uses a cake mix. This means, no measuring of flour or sugar! The only ingredient that really needs to be measured is the vanilla. How can this be? Well, the ingredients are very simple: 1 box of cake mix, 1 stick of butter (no measuring required there), 1 egg, the vanilla which needs measuring, 4 ounces of cream cheese (but cream cheese comes in a brick of 8 ounces, so simply slice it in half), crushed Oreo, white chocolate chips, and chocolate chips. I guess, technically, the Oreos and chocolate chips need to be measured, but I always end up estimating these anyways ðŸ˜Š 

<div style="display:flex;">
The recipe is very straight-forward. First, I like to go ahead and get the Oreos crushed. To do this, I like to place the cookies in a cake pan, and then use a jar to crush them. This is my preferred method, but there are several other ways of doing this. You could put the cookies in a large Ziploc bag, and then use a rolling pin to crush them. Or, instead of a rolling pin, use a mallet. You could potentially put them in a food processor, but if you do this, make sure not to over-process them. You still want some medium-sized cookie chunks.

Then, combine the cake mix, butter, egg, and vanilla in a mixer and beat until a soft dough forms. Then add in the cream cheese and mix again. It's best if the cream cheese is softened. This allows it to be mixed in more easily, and you are not left with chunks of cream cheese in your dough. Finally, fold in the crushed Oreos, chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips by hand. So simple! 

It is best to let the dough refrigerate for about 30 minutes prior to baking. This will keep the cookies from spreading too much as they are baked. However, if you're short on time, chilling is not strictly neccessary. 

These cookies only need to bake for 9 minutes, on a greased cookie sheet, and then only need about a minute to cool slightly on the pan before being removed to cool completely.

<div style="display:flex;">
One thing to note is that they will look underdone when they are removed from the oven. But don't worry, they will firm up slightly as they cool.
