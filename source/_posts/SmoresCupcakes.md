I am a big fan of s'mores. I have tried several different s'more recipes: cupcakes, cakes, cookies, rice krispy treats. And every time I see a new s'more recipe, it peaks my interest. 

<div style="display: flex;">
These cupcakes are absolutely delicious, and they look very impressive once fully assembled. However, I will go ahead and note that this recipe is more time consuming than many others I post. Every once in a while, I get in the mood to really invest my time in a new recipe, and I will try something a little more tedious or complicated. These cupcakes take more time because they involve several steps. You have to make the cupcakes themselves. But then you have to make a chocolate ganache that then goes inside the cupcake. And you have to make the frosting too. And then of course garnish and decorate. Although they are a lot of effort, they are delicious!

For garnishment, I include a graham cracker, mini marshmallow, and piece of Hershey's bar on top of the cupcake. I recommend not garnishing the cupcakes until right before serving them. When I made these the first time, I put all the toppings on right away. The chocolate and the marshmallow did fine. The problem was the graham cracker. Because it was sitting in the frosting overnight, it became soggy. It wasn't the end of the world. It all still tasted good. But if you're a perfectionist like me, you will want the graham cracker to still be crispy when served.

        <ul style="font-family: Arial;">
                <li>2 c heavy cream</li>
                <li>1¼ c powdered sugar</li>
                <li>1 tsp vanilla</li>

        <ul style="font-family: Arial;">
                <li>⅓ c heavy cream</li>
                <li>1 c chocolate chips</li>
        </ul>

        <p style="font-size:150%;"><b>Directions</b></p>
        <ol style="font-family: Arial;">
            <li>Preheat oven to 350°F. Line a muffin tin with cupcake liners.</li>
            <li>In a small pan, heat ½ c butter and coffee until the butter is fully melted. Remove from heat and let cool.</li>
            <li>Melt remaining 2 Tbsp butter and mix with crushed graham crackers in a small bowl. Divide the mixture evenly between the cupcake liners. Press the crust into the bottom of each liner. Bake the crust until golden brown, about 5 minutes. Set aside.</li>
            <li>Whisk together the dry ingredients.</li>
            <li>In a separate large bowl, mix together the eggs, buttermilk, and vanilla. Once cooled, add the butter mixture to the egg mixture.</li>
            <li>Slowly add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients, folding together until just combined.</li>
            <li>Pour batter into prepared cupcake liners and bake 12-15 minutes.</li>
            <li>Make the chocolate ganache: Heat the heavy cream in a small pan over medium-low heat, until it almost comes to a boil, stirring frequently. Pour the hot cream over the chocolate chips. Stir until the chocolate is fully melted. If the chocolate does not fully melt, microwave for 10 second intervals, stirring between, until fully melted. Allow ganache to cool.</li>
            <li>Once cupcakes and ganache have both cooled, fill the cupcakes with the ganache. To do this, use a ¼ teaspoon to scoop out a section of the middle of the cupcake, about ⅓ - ½ of the way deep. Fill the hole with ganache.</li>
            <li>Make the frosting: Using an electric mixer, whip the heavy cream until thick, about 3-5 minutes. Add the powdered sugar and vanilla. Continue beating til stiff peaks form.</li>
            <li>Frost the cupcakes. Immediately before serving, add Hershey's chocolate, graham cracker, and mini marshmallow as garnish.</li>
        </ol> 
        <hr style="height:1px;background-color:rgb(189, 189, 189) ">
        <p style="font-size:150%;"><b>Notes</b></p>
        <ol style="font-family: Arial;">
            <li>Garnish the cupcakes immediately before serving. If you garnish too much ahead of time, the graham cracker will become soft and soggy.</li>
        </ol>
