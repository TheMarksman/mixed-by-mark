Happy Mother's Day to all the wonderful mothers out there!! 
We had a fun, relaxing day, and I hope everyone else had a great day too.

We went over to my parents' house for lunch today. It was beautiful out, so we ate outside, and hung out on their porch for most of the afternoon.

And then Elayne wanted to put her feet in the pool. Which, of course, turned into her splashing everywhere and getting her dress and diaper completely soaked. But she had fun, so that's all that matters. I loved watching her laugh, splashing my dad, mom, and sister. She didn't want to get out, even though the water was cold. Hopefully within the next couple weeks we'll really be able to swim.

And, of course, I did some baking for the day! I made some {% post_link LemonSugarCookieBars Lemon Sugar Cookie Bars %} for dessert, which everyone loved! They are very easy to make. And so satisfying! They are a delicious dessert for summertime and hot weather.
