You can't have a baby shower without some adorable baby treats!

Over the weekend, my mom and I helped to host a baby shower for a friend. While we had already agreed to make some strawberry cupcakes (mom-to-be's favorite) and a couple other desserts, I figured we needed some of the cute factor. So I made these Nutter Butter Babies. 

<div style="display:flex;">
They were actually very easy to make, not nearly as time-consuming as I initially thought they would be. And you don't need many ingredients either.

So how do we make them? Start by melting the white chocolate bark. You can typically find this in the baking section of your grocery store. I highly recommend melting the chocolate in a double boiler. It melts the chocolate evenly and decreases the chances of the chocolate burning. It also helps to keep the chocolate hot while you're dipping the cookies, so that you don't have your chocolate starting to firm up while you're still dipping. Once the chocolate is melted, add in the food coloring. I used blue because my friend is having a boy. But obviously, you can use pink for a girl. Or, if you want to go gender neutral, you could do green or yellow. Or really, any color for that matter.

Next, lay out some wax paper. This is where you will place the cookies after they're covered with chocolate. The wax paper prevents the chocolate from sticking to it. Dip the Nutter Butters in the chocolate so that they are over halfway covered. Try to scrape off some of the excess chocolate without making the chocolate look messy. Honestly, this was the most difficult part. It really just takes some practice. And find the method that works best for you. You could scrape off some of the excess against the side of the pan. Or you could use a spoon to scrape off some of the chocolate. For some cookies, you may go back and forth scraping then re-dipping, then scraping more. No shame in this - I did it many times.

Allow the chocolate to harden before proceeding to adding the eyes and mouth. Trust me, if your white chocolate is still wet, it is very easy to make a mess when adding the details. I recommend waiting. But don't worry, it doesn't take very long for the chocolate to harden. 

In a small bowl, melt some chocolate chips in the microwave. I just heated it for 30 seconds at a time, stirring between each heating, until the chocolate was fully melted and smooth. You don't want to heat it too much at once, or you risk the chocolate burning. Then I transferred the melted chocolate chips to a small squeeze bottle. This allowed me to have more control while decorating. However, if you don't have a squeeze bottle, you could use a small piping tip, or you could even dip a toothpick in the chocolate and carefully draw the details onto the cookies.

However you choose to do it, draw on the details. I drew the eyes to look like they're closed, and a small smile. Also, on some I drew a little curl of hair. I didn't do it on all of them, because it was dependent on the amount of space I had left above the eyes of each cookie. Also, I was worried that it would look like too much if I added it to every cookie. Anyways, the curl of hair is optional. If you're making little girls, you could do a little hairbow or something. Be creative.
