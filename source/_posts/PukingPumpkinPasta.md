Having a Puking Pumpkin is a fun, easy way to serve your Halloween snacks!

I love the puking pumpkin because it is adorable, and it is so versatile! 
I chose to make my puking pumpkin with pasta salad. 
I bought a very easy box of bacon Ranch pasta salad. You cook the noodles, and mix it with some mayonnaise and the seasonings, and it's done. For a party, you always need at least a food or two that is simple and easy to make ahead of time. 

But if you don't want pasta salad, there are so many different options that could work. 

<br>
<br>
Need some ideas? 
You could do: 
<ul>
    <li>Hummus</li>
    <li>Guac</li>
    <li>Spinach artichoke dip</li>
    <li>Mac & cheese</li>
    <li>Veggie dip</li>
    <li>Egg salad</li>
</ul>
Or whatever else you can think of! 

Elayne helped me to carve a small pumpkin with a face that looks like it's puking. She had a lot of fun with it. And my "helping me", I mostly mean she held a spoon while I carved. But she also enjoyed feeling the seeds and slimy pumpkin guts.

Then just arrange the pumpkin and food on a platter to make it look like the food is coming out of the pumpkin's mouth. So easy!
