Last night, we had some friends over for a game night, since Elayne was spending the night with her grandparents. 
So of course, I made a bunch of food. I wanted to try out a few new recipes, one of which was these Ritz sandwiches. Everyone loved them! They are satisfying and delicious, kind of like an adult version of Lunchables.

I love how easy they are to make. And, you can prep them ahead of time. Anyone who has ever cooked a bunch of food for a party or holiday knows that the last hour before guests arrive is always the most hectic. You're trying to get all the food cooked all at once so that it's hot and ready when people arrive. So it's helpful to have as much prepped ahead of time as possible.

Start by placing 48 Ritz crackers in the bottom of baking dishes. Then tear the ham into pieces, and place some ham on top of each cracker.

Then tear the swiss cheese into 1-inch squares. Place a square of cheese on top of the ham. Then place another Ritz cracker on top of the cheese.

Melt the 5 tablespoons of butter in the microwave. Once melted, whisk in the dijon mustard, worcestershire sauce, and salt. Pour this mixture over the cracker sandwiches. Then, sprinkle poppy seeds and onion flakes over the sandwiches.

Bake the sandwiches for 10-12 minutes, until the cheese is melted. The crackers are best served warm. 

If you want to prep the sandwiches ahead of time, I recommend assembling the sandwiches with the crackers, ham, and cheese. But don't pour the sauce over yet. You can refrigerate the sandwiches until it's almost time to start baking. Then whisk together the sauce, pour it over the top, and sprinkle the poppy seeds and onion flakes right before baking.
