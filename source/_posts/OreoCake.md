Tommy's work had a potluck lunch at their office the other day. Tommy signed up to bring a dessert, meaning I had an excuse to do some baking. And baking for people other than yourself is always more fun. Just knowing that other people will be enjoying your baked goods makes it that much more exciting. 

The cake itself was decent, not actually all that much flavor. But the icing... that was the best part! I mean, isn't icing always the best part? But this one was the best icing I think I've ever made. It contains espresso powder, giving it a rich coffee taste. I am a person who loves her coffee, and this is no exception. 

<div style="display:flex;">
It did take a little longer than I expected to make this cake, but it seems that baking always takes just a little longer than initially thought. Maybe I just get so lost in it that I lose track of time. 
But it's not actually hard to make.

This recipe makes two 9-inch cakes. It is necessary to grease and flour the pans, so that the cakes will come out without sticking. If you are unfamiliar with how to grease and flour pans, refer to my post {% post_link GreaseFlourPans How to Grease & Flour Cake Pans %}.

Remove the cream from the Oreo cookies, and place the cookies into a ziploc bag. Use a rolling pin to crush the Oreos into small pieces.

In a large mixing bowl of a stand mixer, with a whisk attachment, beat the softened butter and oil until well combined. Slowly add the sugar, beating on high until the mixture is light and fluffy. Add in the eggs and vanilla. Beat on high until fully incorporated. 

<div style="display:flex;">
In a separate bowl, sift together the cake flour, salt, & baking powder. Alternate mixing in the flour mixture and the buttermilk to the butter mixture. Add in the Oreo pieces and mix well.

Split the cake batter evenly between the prepared cake pans. Bake at 325°F for 40-45 minutes, until an inserted toothpick comes out clean. Allow the cakes to cool before removing from pans and transferring to a wire rack.

While the cakes are baking, you can begin making the frosting. I like to use a hand mixer for the frosting, but you can also use a stand mixer. So using the mixer of your choice, cream together the softened butter, powdered sugar, milk, vanilla, & salt. Beat the ingredients until light and fluffy. Add the espresso powder. Using all 4 tablespoons of espresso powder will make the icing have a strong coffee flavor, which is how I like it. But if you want less of a coffee flavor, you can use less. I would recommend starting with half the amount and then adding more if desired. Finally, add the Oreo pieces and mix by hand under fully combined.

Once the cake is fully cooled, you can assemble and frost it. Place the first layer on your cake stand or platter. Spread a generout amount of icing on top, and add the second layer on the top. Spread icing on the very top and sides of the cake, making sure there is plenty on there. Finally, top the cake with both crushed and full Oreos for garnish.
