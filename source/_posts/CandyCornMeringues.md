Personally, I've never been excited by meringues. They don't typically have much taste, unless you're making a special flavored kind, like the {% post_link PeppermintMeringueCookies Peppermint Meringue Cookies %} I've made before. However, meringues usually look so cute, and they are a fun addition to your party spread. Just make sure you have another dessert or two as well. 

<div style="display:flex;">
Meringues can sometimes be a little finnicky. It's important to make sure the eggs are at room temperature. If you realize "Oh shoot, I forgot to pull the eggs out ahead of time!", so worries. Just let the eggs sit in some warm water for a few minutes, and they'll be room temperature in no time.

Start by preheating the oven to 170°F. For meringues, it's best to bake them at a low heat for a long time. This will prevent them from browning. 
Place a sheet of parchment paper on a baking sheet. 

<div style="display:flex;">
Using a stand mixer with the whisk attachment, beat the egg whites until they are white and foamy. I recommend having the mixer set to a decently high speed. Then mix in the salt and cream of tartar. Mix until soft peaks form.

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, set a timer for 7 minutes. During those 7 minutes, let the mixer keep running, and gradually add the sugar, little bits at a time. Try to take the full 7 minutes to incorporate the sugar. This allows the meringue to get well-whipped.

<div style="display:flex;">
Divide the meringue mixture into 3 bowls and add the yellow and orange food colorings. Make sure that the yellow bowl has the most meringue, and the orange bowl has slightly less. The white meringue can be a small amount.

<div style="display:flex;">
Add the yellow meringue to a piping bag equipped with a large round tip. Pipe medium-sized dollops of yellow meringue onto the baking sheet. The meringue will not expand, so you can place them close together. When piping the meringue, keep the piping bag vertical. When releasing the meringue, be sure to pull up so that your meringue has a nice shape.

Repeat the process with the orange meringue. Add it to a piping bag with a large round tip. Then pipe slightly smaller dollops on top of the yellow meringue. Repeat again with the white meringue, piping even smaller dollops on top of the orange meringue.

<div style="display:flex;">
Bake the meringues for 2 to 2½ hours. Make sure to check them every so often to make sure they are not browning. When the meringues are finished baking, they should be nice and crisp, and they shouldn't collapse when picked up.
