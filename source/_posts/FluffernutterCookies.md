I know, it sounds like these cookies would be overwhelmingly sweet, but trust me, they're not. They are a delicious cookie, especially for anyone who loves peanut butter like I do. 

I made these cookies for Elayne's birthday party on Saturday. They were a big hit! Everyone loved them. My mom even said they were her favorite food of the day (when we had <i>sooo</i> much food)!

These cookies are not difficult to make, but you will make a mess doing it. But that's ok! As I tell Elayne all the time "It's ok to make a mess, as long as you clean up afterwards". ðŸ˜„

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating your oven to 350Â°F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Then, in a medium bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt together. Set this bowl aside until it's time to add it to the dough.

Next, in the bowl of a stand mixer, combine the peanut butter and softened butter. Beat these together until the mixture is creamy. Then, add in Â½ c sugar and the brown sugar. Continue to mix until all ingredients are combined well. Finally, add in the egg and vanilla. Mix again until they are fully incorporated.

Next, gradually add the flour mixture into the dough. Mix between each addition of flour. If you try to add all the flour at once, it will fly everywhere when you turn the mixer on.

<div style="display:flex;">
Now we need to make the cookies. Scoop the dough out into large spoonfuls. Flatten each spoonful of dough into a disc shape. We do this because we are going to put the marshmallow fluff in the center of each cookie.

Now, time for the messy part. Add a small scoop of marshmallow fluff into the middle of each disc of dough. Roll the discs into a rough ball shape. It will not be perfect, but that's alright. We want most of the marshmallow fluff in the center of the ball. Some will poke out, and this is ok. Roll each ball into the remaining Â¼ c sugar, and place them on the prepared baking sheet.

Finally, bake the cookies for 9-10 minutes, until they begin to turn a golden brown. Allow the cookies to cool for a couple minutes on the baking sheet before removing to cool fully.
