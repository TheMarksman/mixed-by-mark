These coconut oatmeal cookies have a delicious yet subtle coconut flavor to them, while also providing the texture of an oatmeal cookie.

I will admit, these cookies are some of my favorites, mostly because I have such good memories associated with them. These are the cookies I baked to be favors at our wedding. They seemed to be the perfect cookies for the occasion. Although he doesn't have a sweet tooth, my husband does like coconut. And of course, I just love cookies in general. These cookies are nice and chewy; if you like crispy cookies, you're wrong ðŸ˜Š The coconut made the cookies feel summer-y, and the oatmeal was a nice complement. Also, with having an outdoor June wedding, it was crucial that the cookies not include chocolate, as it would just melt and become all messy.

I received so many compliments about the cookies that day. Some of my husband's relatives, who I had never met until that day, were raving about them, and it just made me feel so good! And now, every time I make the cookies, I think about our wedding day, and all the love I felt that day.

These coconut oatmeal cookies are very easy to make. The one part that I never enjoyed very much is measuring the coconut oil. No matter how hard I try, I always end up with coconut oil all over my hands! For this recipe, we measure the coconut oil solid. I use a spoon and scoop spoonfuls into a measuring cup until I have the right amount. Then, I transfer the oil to a bowl and heat it in the microwave to melt, then let it cool slightly. The oil needs to be melted so that it can be easily incorporated with the sugars, but we don't want it too hot, or it could end up starting to cook the eggs! 

Other than the measuring of the coconut oil, the rest of the recipe is just like any other cookie: Cream the oil and sugars, add the dry ingredients, and bake. 

Optionally, you can also add some chocolate to these cookies. If desired, simply stir in about a cup of chocolate chips to your dough. Because we were outdoors in the summer, I didn't add chocolate to the cookies for our wedding. But, since then, I have made them with chocolate included. I honestly like them both ways.
