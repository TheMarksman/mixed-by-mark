Happy Easter!! 

We have had a fun, relaxing day today.

Of course, we dyed our Easter eggs the other night. And of course, Elayne loved it! For a child who is so concerned about getting her hands messy, she had no problem getting the dye all over her fingers! ðŸ¤£ 

But she had lots of fun, telling us which colors we needed to do next. And dropping the eggs, not quite gently, into the mugs of dye. And then, once they were all dried, we got to put stickers on them! She had a blast!

This morning, Elayne received her Easter basket and checked out everything inside. Lots of Cocomelon gear ðŸ˜Š She is still obsessed with Cocomelon.

And then, of course, Elayne found Easter eggs! She absolutely loves doing egg hunts! After she found all the eggs, she kept wanting us to hide them again so she could find them again. We did this probably 4 or 5 times! She was having so much fun!

And, since we are on vacation mode right now, we spent some of our morning in the pool!

The other day, I did make some {% post_link EasterCookieBars Easter Cookie Bars %}, with Elayne's help of course. They turned out very well, and we have enjoyed eating them today, in addition to all the Easter candy! ðŸ˜„
