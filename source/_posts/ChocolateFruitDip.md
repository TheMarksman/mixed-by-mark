This is one of the easiest recipes to throw together for a last-minute gathering. The most time-consuming part is washing and cutting all the fruit. But there are shortcuts for that too if you are in a hurry, or just not feeling like doing the work. You can find lots of fruits already washed and cut at your local grocery store.

Make sure your cream cheese is nice and soft. This will make it easier to blend your ingredients together and get a really smooth dip. Combine all the dip ingredients into a large bowl. Use an electric hand mixer to beat the ingredients until the mixture is fully combined and smooth. For dips like this, I prefer the hand mixer, because I think it results in a smoother blend, but you are welcome to use a stand mixer as well.

Now your dip is ready to eat with the fruit of your choice! I personally liked strawberries with it the most. Strawberries with chocolate is just such a classic combination. I also liked pineapple, but that might also be because pineapple is my favorite fruit. 
When I served my dip at our housewarming party last weekend, I wasn't thinking about it too much when I bought the fruit. In addition to strawberries and pineapple, I also bought blueberries and raspberries. They were delicious with the dip, but they weren't the easiest fruit for dipping. So I would recommend making your fruit choices wisely.
