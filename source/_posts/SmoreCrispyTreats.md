These S'more Crispy Treats are so easy to make, and everyone loves them. All you need for these delicious bars is Golden Grahams cereal, mini marshmallows, Hershey's bars, some butter, and a pinch of salt. You essentially make them the same way you would make normal Rice Krispy Treats: melt the butter, add the marshmallows and melt them until smooth. Add in the cereal and stir til coated. The only step this recipe has that the traditional doesn't, is to then stir in the chocolate Hershey's bars pieces and some extra marshmallows. And then you press the entire mixture into a 9x13 pan and let it cool. Easy peasy.

What I love about making any type of Rice Krispy Treat is that they only take about 5 minutes to make. There is very little measuring or prep involved, and you can have a dessert made quickly. They are perfect for last minute get-togethers, when you want to have something sweet on hand.

The only part that some people may not like is that they are messy to make. When I'm finished making these, I typically have marshmallows all over my hands, and the pot is coated in marshmallow and chocolate. But really, it's not that big of a deal. The marshmallow comes off my hands just fine. And if you leave the pot to soak in the sink for a little while, it becomes very easy to clean. 

I will say, I *highly* recommend using mini marshmallows, especially for the marshmallows that are stirred in at the end. The last time I made these, my local grocery store was completely sold out of *all* mini marshmallows. All that were left were the big ones. Standing in the store, I figured, "Not a big deal. I'll just use big marshmallows and cut a few up to stir in. No problem at all." I was wrong. Using big marshmallows to melt and mix with the cereal was simple. It was no different than using mini marshmallows. But when I went to cut up a few marshmallows to stir in, I realized my problem: Marshmallows have a powdery coating around the outside that prevent them from being sticky. 

<div style="display: flex;">
As soon as I started cutting the marshmallows, they were sticking to my hands, my kitchen scissors, the bowl I was putting them in... It was a nightmare. Doable, but not recommended. Finally, after several minutes of struggling against the stickiness, I had my marshamllows cut and ready to go. Then I had to deal with the stickiness again when I went to stir them into my cereal mixture. I had to pull them off the edge of the bowl and then try to get them unstuck from my fingers and into the cereal. Once in the cereal, many of the marshmallows continued to stick together. All in all, it's possible, but not really worth it. If you can't find mini marshmallows at the grocery store, and you're left with only large marshmallows, here's my advice: Simply melt a few more marshmallows with your butter, and forgo stirring in marshmallows at the end.
