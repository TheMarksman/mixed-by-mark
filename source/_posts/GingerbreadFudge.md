I made this fudge for my parents' annual Christmas party, and I had some positive feedback about it. It contains white chocolate, which makes the fudge very rich and creamy. And the cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves makes the fudge taste like gingerbread cookie dough. 

I will say, this fudge (like most fudge) is very rich. So I would recommend cutting the fudge into very small squares so that you're not overwhelmed by the richness of a big piece. Personally, I can only eat a small square at a time before I want another.

This is a super easy recipe to make. You do need several different spices, but most of them are spices you would probably already have in your pantry or spice rack.

Start by lining a 10x10-inch pan with aluminum foil. You can use a smaller pan, but just realize that your fudge will be thicker. I wouldn't recommend using a larger pan than 10x10, because it will probably be much too thin at that point. 
After lining the pan with foil, make sure to spray it with cooking spray. This will prevent the fudge from sticking.

Next, in a medium saucepan, combine the white chocolate chips, brown sugar, molasses, evaporated milk, cinnamon, ginger, allspice, nutmeg, and cloves. Heat the ingredients over medium heat, stirring frequently, until the chocolate is fully melted and the mixture is smooth and combined. 
Remove the pan from the heat, and stir in the vanilla until it is fully incorporated.

Pour the fudge mixture into the prepared pan. It should be pretty thin, so it should spread through the pan pretty evenly. But if you need to, use a spatula to even it out some. Top the fudge with sprinkles. I chose to use some red and green sugar sprinkles. I had actually looked for some different sprinkles, but I couldn't find any other Christmas sprinkles at the grocery store. Anyways, any sprinkles you choose will be great.

Place the pan in the fridge to chill for at least one hour. After chilling, cut the fudge into small squares. In order to prevent getting pieces of foil in your fudge, I recommend pulling the foil and fudge out of your pan. Then peel the foil off the fudge, and place the fudge on a cutting board to slice it.
