Up until yesterday, I had never made my own homemade bread before. But how could I be a baker and never even attempt to make bread?? So I figured I should try it. It turned out much better than I expected! I think I will try more breads in the future. 

My only issue with making bread is the amount of time it takes. You make the dough, but then you have to let it rise, which takes a while. And only after it has fully risen can you bake it. So if you're planning to make your own bread, make sure you have plenty of time for it. 

<div style="display:flex;">
That being said, the dough was very easy to make, and the baking time wasn't too bad. And the bread tasted great, so it was well worth the extra time.

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by combining all the dry ingredients into the bowl of a stand mixer. This includes the flour, Â¾ cup of old-fashioned oats, yeast, and salt.

Then, in a small pan, heat the milk and butter until the butter is just melted. Stir in the warm water and Â¼ cup of honey.

<div style="display:flex;">
Add the milk/butter mixture to the flour mixture. Using the dough hook attachment for the stand mixer, mix the dough for 6-8 minutes. Be sure to check the dough every so often to make sure the dough is not becoming over-kneaded. If the dough is over-kneaded, it will start to feel tough and difficult to stretch.

Once the dough is kneaded, you need to let it rise. Lightly oil a medium-sized bowl. Place the dough into the oiled bowl, and cover it with a clean, dry kitchen towel. Allow it to sit for about an hour so that it can double in size.

<div style="display:flex;">
After you've let the dough rise in the bowl, roll the dough out into a loaf shape. Lightly oil your loaf pan, and place the dough into the pan. Again, let the dough sit for another hour to let it rise further. Once it is finished rising, brush the dough with the remaining 2 tablespoons of honey. Then top the dough with the remaining 2 tablespoons of oats.

Bake the bread at 350Â°F for 40 minutes. After 30 minutes, I rotated my pan so that the bread would bake evenly. Once it is finished baking and the bread is golden brown in color, remove it from the oven. Allow the bread to cool fully before removing it from the loaf pan.

Once cooled, you can slice and enjoy. I loved how the crust had a slightly sweet taste from the honey. But the middle of the bread is not very sweet. This allows the bread to be perfect for many uses. It would be great for sandwiches or french toast. Or, if you have a major sweet tooth like me, top it with some Nutella ðŸ¤¤
