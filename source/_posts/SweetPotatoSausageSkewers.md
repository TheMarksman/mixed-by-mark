I am a huge fan of sweet potatoes. They are very easily my favorite vegetable. Give me sweet potato fries over regular fries any day. At home, I frequently roast sweet potatoes to have as a side with our dinners. That's why I love this appetizer. This is another recipe I made for our game night yesterday.

They are a little tedious to make, just because you need to assemble all the skewers. But, you can still prep ahead of time. 

<div style="display:flex;">
First, preheat the oven to 425°F. Next, peel the sweet potatoes. Cut them into 1-inch cubes. Toss the sweet potatoes with 2 teaspoons of olive oil, the brown sugar, salt, and pepper. Mix this up until the potatoes are evenly coated. Arrange the sweet potatoes in a single layer on a baking sheet. Bake for 20-25 minutes, turning halfway through, until the potatoes are tender.

While the sweet potatoes are cooking, whisk together the Greek yogurt and dijon mustard in a small bowl. Set the sauce aside until it's time to serve the skewers.

Next, cut the sausages into 1-inch slices. It's important that you get precooked sausages. This way, you only need to put them on the stove for a couple minutes to sear them and make sure they're hot. However, if you buy sausages that aren't precooked, you will need to make sure to cook them thoroughly. For precooked sausages, heat the remaining teaspoon of olive oil in a pan over medium heat. Add the sausages to the heated pan. Allow the sausages to sear until crisp, making sure to flip them as needed.

Finally, assemble the skewers. Poke a toothpick through a sweet potato cube, followed by a slice of sausage. Place the skewer on a serving platter, and serve them with the dipping sauce.
