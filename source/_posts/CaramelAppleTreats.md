I love fall, even though here in Georgia it is a very short season. But I love seeing the leaves change, and having cooler weather that isn't very cold yet. Plus, I love all the flavors associated with fall: caramel, apple, pumpkin, cinnamon, sweet potato. The list goes on. 

Over the weekend, we had a Halloween party, and I made these treats as part of the food spread. Everyone raved over them. They are absolutely delicious. It's just like eating a caramel apple, but you get the addition of a salty pretzel.

And, as a bonus, they are so easy to make. All you need are square pretzels, Rolos, Granny Smith apples, and some lemon juice. The quantity of each ingredient is dependent on how many treats you'd like to make. Typically, it is contrained by the amount of Rolos you have. I used 2 bags of Rolos, and I only needed one bag of pretzels and one apple, and then just a little lemon juice.

Start by washing and slicing your apple. I opted to leave the apple skin on, but you could peel it if desired. The apple should be sliced in small, bite-sized pieces. Place the apple pieces in a small bowl, and coat with some lemon juice. The lemon juice will prevent the apple from turning brown. Set your bowl of apples aside until ready to use.

<div style="display:flex;">
Preheat the oven to 170°F. Place the pretzels on an ungreased baking sheet. I recommend using a baking sheet with edges to prevent the pretzels from sliding off. Then top each pretzel with a Rolo. Try to place the Rolo in the center of the pretzel. This will prevent your treats from sticking together.

Bake the treats for about 5 minutes, or until the Rolos are very soft. Remove the pan from the oven, and press an apple piece on top of each Rolo. Place your treats in the fridge to harden. After they have hardened, I recommend removing the treats from the fridge a little while before serving. This will make sure that the caramel isn't too hard when they are being eaten.
