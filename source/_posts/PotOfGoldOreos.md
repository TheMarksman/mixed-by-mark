I know it's not typical to have a St. Patrick's Day party or anything, but these treats are fun for coworkers, school festivities, or just to have around the house.

You do need to melt chocolate on the stove, and you have to be careful dipping the Oreos. So young kids may not be able to help much. But older kids may enjoy making them with you. And all kids can enjoy eating them!

So how do we make these Pots of Gold? 
Start by melting the chocolate in a double boiler on the stove. I used dark chocolate, because I like it and I feel like it's slightly healthier than other chocolates. But you could also use milk chocolate, or even white chocolate if that's what you prefer. You could add some food coloring to the white chocolate to add some color. Be creative with it!

While the chocolate is melting, lay out some wax paper on your counter. The wax paper will prevent the chocolate from sticking. I would recommend laying out some of the AirHeads candies so that you can place the chocolate-dipped Oreos directly on them when you're ready. 
Once the chocolate is fully melted and smooth, coat an Oreo fully in chocolate. I like to drop the Oreo fully into the chocolate, and then use two forks to pick up the coated Oreo and scrape off some of the excess chocolate. Place the Oreo on the wax paper with the rainbow candy at the top and just slightly under the Oreo. 
Finally, place some gold sprinkles at the top of the chocolate Oreo. 
Allow the chocolate to sit and harden fully before serving.
