And yes, I realize we are nowhere near Halloween at the moment. But I have made these treats several times in the past, and I wanted to add some more holiday baking ideas ðŸ˜Š

Pumpkin Pretzels are very simple to make. But they can be a little tedious and time-consuming, because you have to dip each pretzel individually into the white chocolate. However, pretzels in chocolate is always a big hit, and they are the perfect sweet snack!

<br>
You'll need to make sure you have all the ingredients. You will need: 
<ul>
    <li>Pretzels (the twist kind)</li>
    <li>White chocolate bark</li>
    <li>Orange food coloring</li>
    <li>M&M's</li>
<ul>

<div style="display:flex;">
First, you need to melt your white chocolate. I like to use the type of chocolate pictured to the right. This one was from Walmart, but you can find the chocolate bark at most grocery stores. I like to melt my chocolate using a double boiler. It helps to heat the chocolate evenly so that it doesn't burn as easily. Also, by using a double boiler, the chocolate can stay hot for however long it takes you to dip all your pretzels. If you decide to melt your chocolate in the microwave, you may end up needing to melt it again if it starts to solidify.

Once your chocolate is fully melted, add some orange food coloring. The amount you add is up to you, depending on how orange you want your pumpkins. Make sure to stir the chocolate and food coloring well so that you don't have streaks of food coloring left. 

Now you get to dip your pretzels. Because we are wanting to cover the entire pretzel, I like to toss a couple pretzels in, and then have a fork in each hand to pick up the pretzel and scrape off any excess chocolate. Once the pretzel is fully covered in chocolate, place it on some wax paper. The wax paper will prevent the chocolate from sticking. Before the chocolate hardens, add an M&M to the top. To make the pretzel look like a pumpkin, I recommend using either green or brown M&M's. I ended up also using some orange ones too, because I didn't have enough green and brown for all the pretzels I made. And I didn't want to buy an entire extra bag of M&M's just for a couple colors. 

Once you have dipped all your pretzels and added the M&M's, leave the pretzels to sit until the chocolate has hardened. This will probably take an hour or so to be fully hardened. Now you can enjoy!
