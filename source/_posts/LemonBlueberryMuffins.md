I've made these muffins a few different times, and each time I've received lots of compliments about them. They are very lemon-y without being overwhelming. 

They also have a delicious crumb topping, which makes them even more irresistable. If you ask me, any muffin that has a crumb topping is automatically better than those without. And this crumb topping contains oatmeal, which gives it a uniquely satisfying cruch.

These muffins are also easy to make. More steps than you'll see in some cookies, but nothing actually difficult.

Start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Line some muffin pans with muffin liners. Then proceed to make the crumb topping. In a small bowl, combine the melted butter, sugar, flour, oats, and salt. Mix it with a fork until it is combined and crumbly. Set the topping aside for later.

Next, in the bowl of a stand mixer, beat the softened butter until it's fluffy. Add in the sugar. Continue mixing until the butter and sugar are well-combined. Then add the eggs, mixing until just incorporated. Finally, add the buttermilk, vanilla, and lemon zest, mixing until well-combined.

In a separate medium bowl, combine together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually stir the flour mixture into the butter mixture until just combined.

Divide the batter evenly into the prepared muffin pans. I like to only fill each muffin ⅔ - ¾ full. That way, the muffins do not expand too much over the top. Sprinkle the prepared crumb topping onto the top of each muffins. Bake the muffins for 22-25 minutes, until you can insert a toothpick into the middle of a muffin and have it come out clean. Allow the muffins to cool for a few minutes before removing them from the pan to cool completely.

Finally, make the glaze by mixing together the lemon juice and powdered sugar until the mixture is smooth. Drizzle the glaze onto the cooled muffins. The glaze adds a nice lemon-y, sweet touch to an already delicious muffin.
