I made these cookies for my parents' annual Christmas party this year. I had so many people telling me how much they liked them, and that they had eaten several of them. I love getting all the positive feedback, and now I know to make them more often. 

Sugar cookies are a simple and delicious treat that everyone can enjoy. And these cookies include the yummy peppermint flavor, with a delicious chocolate candy on top. How could you go wrong?

These cookies are very easy to make. But you do have to find the Candy Cane Hershey's Kisses, which can typically only be found around Christmas-time. I wish I could find them year-round because I absolutely love the Candy Cane Kisses!

Start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Grease a baking sheet with cooking spray. Then unwrap all the Candy Cane Kisses. This way, they are all ready for when you place them on the cookies. They need to be placed on the cookies while the cookies are still hot, so you don't want to be wasting time unwrapping all the candies while the cookies sit there cooling. Set aside the Kisses until you're ready to use them. 

<div style="display:flex;">
In the bowl of a stand mixer, cream together the softened butter, powdered sugar, egg, vanilla, and peppermint extract. Your mixture should be smooth and fully combined.

In a separate medium bowl, combine the flour, baking powder, and salt. Gradually add the flour mixture to the butter mixture, mixing well between each addition. The dough will be very thick.

Roll the dough into 1-inch balls, and roll each ball of dough in the extra ⅓ cup of sugar. Place the cookies on the prepared baking sheet.

<div style="display:flex;">
Bake the cookies for 8-10 minutes, until the cookies are set. The bottoms of the cookies will turn golden, but the tops will not, so don't wait for that. If you do, the cookies will be overbaked.

<div style="display:flex;">
Allow the cookies to cool on the pan for just a minute. Then place a Kiss in the center of each cookie. Be sure to press the Kiss in the cookie gently. If you press too hard, the cookie will split apart. A little cracking is ok, as long as the cookie is not breaking apart. 
<div>

Remove the cookies from the pan and allow them to cool completely. They are fully cooled when the Kiss on top feels solid again.
