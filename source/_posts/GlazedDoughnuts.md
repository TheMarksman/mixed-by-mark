I had never tried making doughnuts before, so this was a great opportunity to try, especially because Elayne loves doughnuts!

These doughnuts are baked, not fried. So they aren't as airy or light as Krispy Kreme, but they are still delicious. They are sweet and cake-y, with a yummy glaze on top. 

Growing up, my mom never deep fried anything, because she never liked to deal with the mess of frying. And I am the same way. I have no desire to fry foods, so I will stick with baked doughnuts.

These classic doughnuts are easy to make. And all of the ingredients are items most bakers would find in their pantry or fridge already.

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350Â°F. Grease your doughnut pan with nonstick cooking spray. Then whisk together the flour, sugar, baking powder, and salt in a large bowl. Set this bowl aside.

Next, mix the wet ingredients together. In a small bowl, mix together the melted butter, egg, milk, and vanilla. Whisk these until they are fully combined.

Add the wet ingredients into the dry ingredients, and mix them until just combined. I had a good little helper with my baking today. She wanted to do all the mixing. So naturally, flour ended up all over the counter! ðŸ˜› She was also my taste-tester. She had to make sure the sprinkles all tasted good enough for everyone else to eat! ðŸ˜„

Once the batter is completely mixed, use a pastry bag to pipe the batter into the prepared doughnut pan. This is a very thin batter, and so I found it easiest to pipe it. If you don't have a pastry bag, you can pour the batter into a Ziploc bag, and then cut off one corner and pipe it into the pan that way. Otherwise, you can simply spoon the batter into the pan. But I found spooning this batter to be messier than piping.

Bake the doughnuts for 10-12 minutes. They are ready when you can insert a toothpick and have it come out clean. Let the doughnuts cool in the pan for about 5 minutes before transferring them to a wire rack to cool completely.

Next, make the glaze. In a small bowl, whisk together the powdered sugar, milk, and vanilla. If the glaze is too thick, you can add a little more milk until you reached your desired consistency. You want the glaze to be decently runny, so that it will cover the doughnut but not glob on top of it. 
Once the doughnuts are completely cool, dip the doughnuts into the glaze. Then you can top it with sprinkles if you'd like. I like adding sprinkles, because they make the doughnuts more fun ðŸ˜Š 
Allow the glaze to set for about 30 minutes before serving.
