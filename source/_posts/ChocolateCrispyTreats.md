We had my family over for dinner a couple weeks ago. And so of course, I wanted to make a dessert for the occasion. I made these treats, not really knowing how they would turn out. But, when these bars include Cocoa Puffs, Nutella, marshmallows, and chocolate chips, how could they possibly be anything but delicious?! 

However, they turned out even better than expected! They are very chocolate-y, and rich and indulgent. And so addicting. My mom asked for the recipe, and she actually made them the following day when she had some friends over. And she said that all her friends loved them too.

And, in addition to being delicious, these bars are also super easy to make. You make them in the same way you would Rice Krispy treats. Start by greasing a 9x13-inch pan. Otherwise, your bars will stick to the pan, and you'll have a big mess trying to get them out.

In a large pot over medium heat, melt the butter. Once it is fully melted, add 10 ounces of marshmallows (typically a full bag, depending on the brand of marshmallows you buy), and stir continuously until the marshmallows are all melted and smooth. Stir in the Nutella and vanilla until they are well combined. 

<div style="display:flex;">
Now, add the Cocoa Puffs, remaining marshmallows, chocolate chips, and white chocolate chips. Mix until all the dry ingredients are well coated with melted marshmallow. Finally, press the mixture into the greased 9x13-inch pan. If it's sticky and difficult to deal with, a good tip is to spray some grease on your hands to keep the marshmallows from sticking to them.

Allow the bars to fully cool before cutting them and eating.
