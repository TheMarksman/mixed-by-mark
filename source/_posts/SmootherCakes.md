<div class="post-body">
Have you ever baked a cake, and upon removing it from the oven, noticed little bubbles on the top of it? 

<!--more-->

Get a smoother cake by releasing those trapped air bubbles before baking. 
After pouring the batter into the cake pan, simply drop the pan onto the counter a couple of times. This will force the air bubbles up to the surface. 

Now you can have a smoother, prettier cake!
