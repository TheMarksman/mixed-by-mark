They are light and crisp. The acidity from the lime cuts some of the sweetness. So even though these bars contain white chocolate, they don't taste quite as sweet as your standard rice krispie treat. 
And of course, they are still just as easy to make as normal rice krispie treats.

Start by greasing a 9x13-inch pan with cooking spray. Make sure it is well-coated so that the marshmallows don't stick. Set the prepared pan aside until later. In a medium pan over low heat, melt the butter until it's fully melted. Then add in the marshmallows, lime zest, and lime juice. Stir almost continuously until the marshmallows are fully melted and all ingredients are combined. Remove the pan from the heat.

Sitr in the Rice Krispies cereal and crushed graham crackers until fully coated. Then stir in the white chocolate chips until well-combined. Press the mixture into the prepared 9x13-inch pan until it's in an even layer and covering the entire bottom of the pan. I recommend spraying a little cooking spray on your hands first. This helps prevent the marshmallows from sticking to your fingers. Allow the treats to cool fully before cutting and serving them.
