Since we were having some of Tommy's coworkers over the other night, I decided I wanted to try a slightly more intricate dessert than just making cookies. So I decided to try a mousse cake, having never made mousse cake before. I was very nervous that it wouldn't turn out well, made extra nervous by the fact that I had never met Tommy's coworkers and wanted to make a good impression. 

I guess I didn't need to worry nearly as much as I did. Everyone loved the cake! Some people even had a second piece. I was so excited! 

<div style="display:flex;">
This cake is a little more involved than other recipes I've blogged about, but it isn't actually difficult. Just more steps and more time-consuming. One ingredient you'll need that you may not have worked with before is unflavored gelatin. You can find it by the jello at your grocery store.

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Lightly grease a 9-inch springform pan. Then, line the bottom of the pan with parchment paper. Next, wrap the springform pan with two layers of aluminum foil. Place the springform pan into a larger pan, and fill the larger pan with about an inch of hot water. Baking the cake in a pan of water helps prevent the edges of the cake from drying out.

Now that your pan is prepared, make the cake. Start by melting the 10 ounces of semisweet chocolate in a large microwavable bowl until it's smooth. Set the chocolate aside for a moment. Place the egg whites in the bowl of a stand mixer. Add in half of the sugar and beat on low speed, increasing speed until the mixture is fluffy. Add in the remaining sugar, salt, and vanilla. Continue beating until all ingredients are mixed and soft peaks form.

<div style="display:flex;">
Stir softened butter into the melted chocolate. Then mix in the egg yolks. Gently fold half of the sugar mixture into the chocolate mixture until fully mixed in. Then fold in the rest of the sugar mixture.

Pour the batter into the prepared pan. Bake for 26-28 minutes. The cake is finished baking when you can insert a toothpick into the center and have it come out clean. Allow the baked cake to cool to room temperature. Then refrigerate the cake for an hour. When the cake cools, it will sink some; this is normal.

</div>

After the cake is cooled, run a knife around the perimeter of the pan to loosen the cake from the edges. Unlock the springform pan and remove the outer ring. Invert the cake onto a serving platter. Remove the bottom of the pan and the parchment paper. Place the springform ring back around the cake to serve as a mold for the mousse.

Next, it's time to make the semisweet chocolate mousse. Place the 10 ounces of semisweet chocolate into a large microwavable bowl. Set this bowl aside for a moment. 

In a small bowl, mix together 1 teaspoon of unflavored gelatin and 2 tablespoons of cool water. Set it aside and allow it to form a jelly-like texture. 

<div style="display:flex;">
Next, pour half a cup of heavy cream in a small pan. Bring to a boil. Once boiled, pour the hot cream over the set-aside chocolate. Stir until the cream and chocolate are fully mixed and the chocolate is completely melted. If necessary, place the bowl in the microwave for 30 seconds at a time to get the chocolate to finish melting.
<div>
    {% asset_img floating-image TripleChocolateMousseCake10.jpg %}
</div>
</div>

In a pan over low heat, allow the softened gelatin to melt, stirring constantly. Pour the melted gelatin into the melted chocolate mixture. 

Pour the remaining one cup of heavy cream into the bowl of a stand mixer. Whip the cream until soft peaks form. Fold the whipped cream into the chocolate until fully incorporated.

<div style="display:flex;">
Spread the mousse over the top of the cooled cake. Place the cake back in the fridge while making the white chocolate mousse.

</div>

Now you need to make the white chocolate mousse. To do this, follow the same steps as for the semisweet chocolate mousse, except with white chocolate. Spread the white chocolate mousse over the top of the semisweet chocolate mousse layer. Place the cake back in the fridge and allow to cool at least 4-5 hours, or overnight. 
<div style="display:flex;">

</div>

<div style="display:flex;">
Before serving, run a knife around the perimeter of the cake to prevent the edges from sticking to the pan. Open the lock of the springform pan and remove the outer ring. Use a vegetable peeler to shave curls off the semisweet chocolate bar for a garnish.
