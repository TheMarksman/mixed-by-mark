This past weekend, my mom and I helped host a baby shower for a friend. I decided to make these as part of the desserts, and they were a big hit! I had doubled the recipe, and almost all of them were gone by the time the shower was over!

I love key lime pie, and these are the perfect bite-sized take on that. They are incredibly quick and easy to make. I will definitely be making them again in the future. The only downside to these is that the phyllo shells can be a little expensive. So I probably wouldn't plan to make these key lime bites for a huge party. But they were perfect for a baby shower of 25 people.

<div style="display:flex;">
Start by preheating the oven to 350°F. Place the phyllo shells on a baking sheet. I recommend using a baking sheet with edges so that the shells don't slide off.

Wash and zest the lime. 
In a medium bowl, combine the sweetened condensed milk, sour cream, key lime juice, and 1 teaspoon of lime zest. Stir until the ingredients are well-mixed.

<div style="display:flex;">
Spoon the lime mixture into the phyllo shells, filling them almost all the way up. Bake for 5 minutes, then remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes.

Place the key lime bites in the fridge to chill for at least 30 minutes. Immediately before serving, sprinkle the graham cracker crumbs and remaining lime zest for garnish.
