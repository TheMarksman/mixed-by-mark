We've never been huge into Valentine's Day. In the past, we've gone out to dinner either the night before or the night after Valentine's Day. It was just easier and more relaxing - no needing to worry about booking reservations way in advance, or dealing with crowds everywhere. 

But this year was even more relaxed. Tommy and Elayne have had colds for the past several days. So we weren't going to be going out anywhere. We just hung around the house today. Tommy did some work from home, I watched Elayne - usual day.

Luckily, Elayne is pretty much over her cold by now, so she and I got to go outside and play some this afternoon. We are both tired of being stuck at home.

We did plan to do a slightly nicer dinner than usual tonight, so that was nice. We made a steak with bleu cheese onion sauce, roasted sweet potatoes, and salad. It was very yummy! I will definitely be making again in the future. I also put some candles on the dinner table, which we never do, as my attempt to make the night feel a little more special and romantic.

And, of course, a holiday is not complete without some sort of sweet treat! So I made this yummy and light {% post_link RaspberryWhip Raspberry Whip %}. It is sweet, a little tart, and lighter than most desserts - making you feel less guilty about indulging!
