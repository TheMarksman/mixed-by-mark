For such a simple and common cookie, Chocolate Chip is always a crowd-pleaser. These cookies have both the satisfying sweet dough that makes the perfect cookie base, but then when you add chocolate, it can only improve. Because it is not over-the-top sweet, these cookies pair nicely with everything: milk, coffee, other cookies ðŸ˜‰

The recipe is pretty simple. All you need is butter, butter flavored shortening, sugar, brown sugar, vanilla, eggs, all-purpose flour, baking soda, salt, and of course, yummy chocolate chips. I like to use mini semi-sweet chocolate chips, but any will do perfectly. 
The butter flavored shortening can be found near the Crisco in the baking aisle of the grocery store.

When I was growing up, my mom always baked chocolate chip cookies using her Pampered Chef stone baking sheet. It's funny the things we pick up from our parents. Because of this, I always bake my chocolate chip cookies using a stone baking sheet. But I don't usually think about baking other cookies on stone... You can choose to bake these cookies on a stone baking sheet, or just use your favorite one. They should turn out great either way.

The recipe is simple to make. Start with your softened butter and butter shortening. Cream these together in a stand mixture until they are well combined. Then, add in the sugar, brown sugar, and vanilla. Mix until it is smooth. Next, add in the eggs, and mix again. 

In a separate bowl, combine the flour, baking soda, and salt. Slowly add these dry ingredients to your butter mixture, mixing between each addition. 

Finally, stir in the chocolate chips by hand. Spoon the dough onto the baking sheet and bake for 9-11 minutes. Allow the cookies to sit on the pan for 1-2 minutes before removing to cool completely.

            <li>I bake my chocolate chip cookies using a stone baking sheet, but any baking sheet will be fine. If not using stone, make sure to spray your baking sheet with cooking spray so that they do not stick.</li>
            <li>I like to pull the cookies out of the oven when they are a light golden color. This will allow them to be very soft and chewy.</li>
