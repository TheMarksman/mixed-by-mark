A different take on the previously posted Pretzel Treats, these Turtle Treats are another bit hit.

These Turtle Treats are exactly like the Pretzel Treats, except they use Rolos instead of Hershey's Hugs and pecans instead of M&M's. They are so satisfying because they give you the perfect salty and sweet mixture, plus the creamy caramel. 

When I was younger, I didn't care for this variation, probably because it contained nuts, and I used to be a picky eater. But now that I'm older, and enjoy a much wider variety of foods, I really enjoy these. They are typically included in my holiday baking and sometimes for parties as well. They are so easy to make, how could they not be a go-to party snack? 

Just like with the Pretzel Treats, the most time consuming and tedious part of making the Turtle Treats is unwrapping all the Rolos. I like to do this ahead of time, while I'm sitting on the couch watching TV. It makes the whole task much more enjoyable. 

<div style="display: flex;">
The steps to make the Turtle Treats are the same as the Pretzel Treats. We start by lining a baking sheet with square pretzels, and then place an unwrapped Rolo on the center of each pretzel. The square pretzels work best to keep the chocolate from seeping through to the baking sheet. Keeping the Rolo to the center of the pretzel prevents the treats from sticking together too much, although this is not as big of an issue with the Turtle Treats as it is with the Pretzel Treats. This is because the Rolos do not spread nearly as much as the Hershey's Hugs.

Next, bake the pretzels for about 5 minutes at 150°F, or until the center of the Rolo is soft. To test this, I take a pecan and press it into one of the Rolos in the middle of the pan. It if presses in easily, they are ready to come out of the oven. 

Immediately after taking the pan out of the oven, press a pecan into each Rolo. This needs to be done before the chocolate cools too much. When selecting pecans from the bag, I try to select the ones that are not broken, just to make the treats look better. But using pecan pieces works just as well. Then allow the chocolate to cool and harden. You can do this by allowing it to cool at room temperature, or by placing the baking pan in the refrigerator.
