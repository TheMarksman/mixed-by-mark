Happy St. Patrick's Day!! 

<br>
<!--more-->

I know that St. Patrick's Day isn't really a big deal in Atlanta, or in many places really. But I was born in Savannah, where it's a really big deal. All the kids have the day off school. There is a huge parade, full of marching bands, floats, bagpipes, Irish dancers, and every other parade necessity. 

Growing up, my family went to the parade every year. We would get up super early, head downtown, and set up our chairs to stake out our spot. We would have to sit around for hours, waiting for the parade to start, all so we could have good seats. 

You may be thinking this sounds boring, sitting around for hours, waiting for the parade. But it really wasn't. We would pack a bunch of food, have a breakfast picnic, do some people watching (there were always interesting people around to watch), buy a bunch of green items from the vendors around, and go for walks around the downtown area. 

I miss being in Savannah for St. Patrick's Day, and I'm hoping we'll be able to take Elayne to the parade next year. I think she would have a lot of fun watching all the excitement.

This year, we had a relaxing day at home. Tommy took the day off work, not for St. Patrick's Day, but because a new video game came out today (of course ðŸ˜›).

We did go out to breakfast as a family, and Elayne got all the compliments about her adorable green shamrock dress.

Elayne was also in a really good mood today. She had a lot of fun pretending to cook with her bowls and spoons, and eating at her new Minnie Mouse table.

In addition to relaxing at home today, I also did some St. Patrick's Day baking ðŸ˜Š
