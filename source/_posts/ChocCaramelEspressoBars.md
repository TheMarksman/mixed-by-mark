This past weekend, Tommy and I actually had free time! Elayne spent the entire weekend with her grandparents. That means Tommy and I were actually able to make evening plans with friends! 

We had a friend come over to play some board games in the afternoon, and then we all met a couple other friends for dinner. So, of course, I wanted to do some baking before people came over! 

I decided to make these Chocolate Caramel Espresso Bars, which proved to be rich, indulgent, and delicious! They consist of a layer of graham cracker crust, a layer of smooth caramel, and finally a layer of rich chocolate espresso ganache. This dessert is not very difficult to make, but it is a little  more time consuming, simply because you need to let each layer cool before adding the next. 

We start by preheating the oven to 350Â°F. Line an 8x8 pan with foil. Lightly spray it with cooking spray.

Then, we need to make the graham cracker crust. Combine the graham cracker crumbs, sugar, and melted butter in a bowl and mix well. Press this mixture into the bottom of the prepared pan. Bake for 10 minutes, then allow to cool slightly.

Next, we need to make the caramel. In a saucepan, combine the heavy cream, butter, brown sugar, and water. Over medium heat, stir until all ingredients are combined and the mixture is smooth. Then, increase the heat to high, and allow the mixture to boil, without stirring, for 5-7 minutes. Remove the caramel from heat, and carefully pour the caramel onto the graham cracker crust. Allow the pan to sit for 20 minutes to cool. Then, freeze until the caramel is firm, at least 30 minutes.

Now we need to make the ganache. Combine the chocolate chips and heavy cream in a microwave-safe bowl. Heat for 30 seconds at a time then stir, repeating until the mixture is smooth. Then mix in the espresso powder. Pour the chocolate ganache over the chilled caramel. Sprinkle sea salt on top. Allow the dessert to chill in the freezer for about 2 hours, until firm.

Once the dessert has been chilled enough, remove from the freezer and cut into bars. Because this dessert is so rich, I recommend cutting it into about 25 squares, instead of large bars. Now you're ready to enjoy!! 

And while Tommy and I enjoyed a free weekend with friends, Elayne had fun with her grandparents ðŸ˜Š
