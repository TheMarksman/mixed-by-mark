Just like with the Pumpkin Pretzels, they can be a little tedious, simply because you need to dip each Oreo into the chocolate individually. And then you also need to add a little decoration to each Oreo as well. 

Start by melting some white chocolate in a double boiler. Once the chocolate is completely melted and smooth, drop an Oreo into the chocolate, turning it so that it's completely coated. Allow any excess chocolate to drip off, and then place the Oreo on a sheet of wax paper. 

Before the white chocolate hardens, place two mini chocolate chips on the Oreo to serve as the eyes.
