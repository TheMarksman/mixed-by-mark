Happy St. Patrick's Day!!

<!--more-->

We didn't do much for the holiday, mostly just had a relaxing day at home. 
Elayne had her swim lessons this morning, which she loves! And then we went out for a family breakfast. But other than that, we hung around the house, playing and having family time. 

We played outside for a while today. Elayne recently got a tricycle, and so she's trying to learn how to peddle. And in the meantime, she's loving having me and Tommy push her around on it. And every time we go outside, we have to draw with some chalk, really meaning, Mommy draws whatever Elayne wants ðŸ˜‚

We also spent quite a while on Elayne's bounce house. Elayne had a blast! She was bouncing all over the place, laughing the whole time. And she kept throwing balls at me and Tommy, so that we would throw them back at her. It was a good time ðŸ˜Š

And, of course, Elayne and I did some baking for St. Patrick's Day! Because you shouldn't have a holiday without some baking! 
We made some {% post_link PotOfGoldOreos Pot of Gold Oreos %} and {% post_link LuckyCharmsMintCookies Lucky Charms Mint Cookies %}. Check them out!
